# Changelog

All notable changes to DigiLab will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.3.1] - 2026-03-04 - Fixes & Upload Improvements

### Fixed
- **Achievement scores include all events**: Achievement scores now correctly include all event types. Only competitive rating (Elo) excludes unrated events.
- **Title strip dropdown styling**: Styled native `<select>` options with dark blue backgrounds matching the scene selector, fixing white-on-white text in Chrome light mode.
- **Upload Results UI language**: Updated wizard step from "Upload Screenshots" to "Upload Results", promoted CSV as recommended upload method, renamed process button.

### Added
- **CSV upload validation**: File size limit (500KB), row cap (300), required column checks, ranking/points range validation to prevent malformed uploads.

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-04 - Mobile Views & PWA Fixes

### Added
- **Three-dot menu modal**: Replaced Bootstrap dropdown with a styled modal matching the admin login pattern. Contains FAQ, For Organizers, Roadmap (external links), Report a Bug, and Request a Store actions.
- **Mobile Upload in help modal**: Upload Results link appears in the help modal on mobile only, replacing the former 6th tab bar item.
- **Store request shared function**: Extracted `show_store_request_modal()` so it can be triggered from the help modal, stores tab, and submit tab without requiring DOM elements to be rendered.
- **Mobile player card redesign**: Upgraded from plain text rows to styled cards with tier-colored rating badges, gold/silver/bronze left borders for top 3, color-coded W-L-T records, and full-opacity deck badges.
- **Rating tier system**: Fixed-threshold rating tiers (1800+ elite gold, 1700+ strong cyan, 1600+ good green, <1500 muted) displayed as pill badges with light/dark mode variants.
- **Mobile meta card redesign**: Deck color left borders replace color dots, meta % shown as deck-color-tinted pill badge, two-row layout with entries and win%/top 3s.
- **Mobile tournament card redesign**: Two-row layout with store name + format pill badge (top), date/type + trophy icon winner (bottom).
- **All Scenes store directory**: "All Scenes" now shows scene summary cards (name, store count, events, avg players) instead of listing every store. Clicking navigates to that scene. Applied to desktop cards/schedule views and mobile.
- **Mobile store card redesign**: Two-row layout with store name + events badge (top), schedule/location + star rating (bottom). Online organizer cards updated similarly.
- **Map scene-aware bounding boxes**: Desktop, mobile, and admin scene maps now fit bounds around both stores and the scene's center coordinates, ensuring the full scene area is visible.
- **Casuals event type**: New "Casuals" event type available for tournament entry.
- **Unrated event types**: Casuals, Regulation Battles, Release Events, and Other events are excluded from competitive rating calculations (achievement scores still include all events).
- **CSV upload support**: Upload Results tab now accepts Bandai TCG+ CSV exports alongside screenshots. CSV files are parsed directly without OCR.

### Fixed
- **Dropdown text color**: Title strip format/event type dropdown options styled with dark backgrounds for readability.

### Changed
- **Mobile tab bar**: Reduced from 6 tabs to 5 (removed Upload Results) for a cleaner mobile navigation.
- **Mobile card borders**: Increased border contrast and added box-shadow for better card separation.

### Added (prior)
- **Mobile device detection**: JS detects device type on page load, sends to Shiny via `input$device_info`. Server-side `is_mobile()` reactive drives conditional rendering.
- **Dedicated mobile views**: 5 new mobile view files (`views/mobile-dashboard-ui.R`, `mobile-players-ui.R`, `mobile-meta-ui.R`, `mobile-tournaments-ui.R`, `mobile-stores-ui.R`) with purpose-built layouts for small screens.
- **Mobile stacked cards**: Players, Meta, Tournaments, and Stores pages replace reactable tables with tappable card layouts on mobile. Load-more pagination (20 cards at a time).
- **Mobile dashboard**: All desktop dashboard sections available on mobile — value boxes, charts (with hidden legends/axis labels for space), horizontal-scroll Rising Stars and Top Decks.
- **Mobile stores map**: Compact 200px map with store cards below.
- **Mobile CSS foundation**: New `www/mobile.css` with shared card, horizontal scroll, compact map, and section header styles.
- **PWA icon sizes**: 7 additional icon sizes (48–384px) for broader device support.
- **Dark mode tab bar**: Dedicated dark theme variant for mobile bottom navigation.
- **Mobile dashboard accordion**: All dashboard sections (Top Decks, Rising Stars, Recent Tournaments, analytics charts) in a unified collapsible accordion. Top Decks and Rising Stars open by default.
- **Mobile compact cards**: Redesigned Top Decks (150px with 130px card art, color borders, win rate bars) and Rising Stars (rank badges, desktop-matching placement badges, JetBrains Mono rating).
- **Mobile recent tournaments**: Card-based layout with date badge, store/winner info, player count, and country flags for "All Scenes" view.
- **Meta Share Over Time tooltip grouping**: Decks under 3% meta share are summed into an "Other (N decks)" line in the tooltip.

### Fixed
- **iOS Safari auto-zoom**: Added `font-size: 16px` to mobile form inputs to prevent zoom on focus.
- **Upload Results responsive**: Converted 4 fixed `col_widths` to `breakpoints()` for proper mobile stacking.
- **Safe area insets**: Added `env(safe-area-inset-bottom)` to tab bar, content, and footer for iPhone X+ notch/home bar.
- **Mobile content clipping**: Reset sidebar layout negative margins on mobile and increased content padding.
- **Store form alignment**: Replaced hardcoded `padding-top: 32px` with flexbox alignment.
- **Format dropdown not populating**: Format choices are now computed at render time inside each page's `renderUI`, fixing a race condition where `updateSelectInput` fired before dynamically-rendered selectInputs existed in the DOM.
- **Mobile header-content gap**: Neutralized bslib's `layout_sidebar` CSS grid on mobile (`display: block`) to eliminate ~1 inch of whitespace between header and content.
- **Mobile value boxes 1x4 layout**: Replaced `layout_columns` (which collapsed to 1 column below bslib's `md` breakpoint) with CSS grid for guaranteed 2x2 layout.

### Changed
- **Conditional page rendering**: Public pages now use `uiOutput` wrappers with `renderUI` that sources either desktop or mobile view files based on `is_mobile()`.
- **Scrollbar selector**: Scoped from `*` to `body` for better performance.
- **Shared data reactives**: Meta and Tournaments server modules refactored to share data between desktop tables and mobile cards.
- **Value box labels**: Renamed "HOT DECK" to "TRENDING" and "TOP DECK" to "MOST PLAYED" on both desktop and mobile for clarity.
- **Title strip dropdowns**: Restyled from white to semi-transparent blue (`rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`) with white text, matching the header scene selector aesthetic.
- **Meta Share Over Time legend**: Removed on both desktop and mobile (tooltip provides deck details on hover).
- **Dead CSS removed**: ~195 lines of responsive CSS that targeted components no longer rendered on mobile (replaced by dedicated mobile views).
- **UI files sourced at render time**: Desktop UI files (`dashboard-ui.R`, `players-ui.R`, etc.) changed from static startup-sourced variables to render-time sourced tagLists, enabling format choices to be populated at render time.

### Infrastructure
- Added `viewport-fit=cover` meta tag and `apple-mobile-web-app-title` for PWA.
- CSS media query index comment added to top of `custom.css`.
- Design docs: `docs/plans/2026-03-03-mobile-views-design.md`, `docs/plans/2026-03-03-mobile-views-plan.md`.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-03 - Rating System Redesign & DigiLab Website

### Changed
- **Rating algorithm rewrite**: Replaced the old 5-pass iterative system with a single-pass chronological processor. Ratings are now deterministic — same data always produces the same result. No more time-based decay, no more butterfly effect from unrelated tournaments.
- **Tie handling fixed**: Ties now properly score as 0.5 instead of counting as losses for both players.
- **All 1,128 rated players recalculated**: Rating distribution tightened from a 514-point spread to 281 points. About half of players moved up, half moved down. Average change: +1.3 points.

### Added
- **DigiLab website**: Public-facing site at [digilab.cards](https://digilab.cards) with blog, public roadmap, and landing page. Built with Astro, hosted on Vercel.
- **Blog posts**: "New Rating System: What Changed and Why" (analysis) and "One Week In: DigiLab's First Scenes" (devlog) with interactive Highcharts visualizations.
- **Rating comparison tooling**: `scripts/analysis/` contains algorithm comparison, chart generation, and scene map scripts used for the blog post data.

### Infrastructure
- App moved from digilab.cards to [app.digilab.cards](https://app.digilab.cards)
- digilab.cards now serves the public website

---

## [1.1.2] - 2026-03-01 - Cross-Scene Player Collision Fix

### Fixed
- **Cross-scene player collisions**: Players with the same name in different scenes (e.g., "Matt" in DFW vs "Matt" in Pennsylvania) were incorrectly merged when results were entered. Name-only matching now scopes to players who have competed in the same scene as the tournament being entered. Bandai ID matching remains global (same ID = same player everywhere).

### Added
- **Duplicate detection script**: `scripts/analysis/detect_cross_scene_duplicates.R` identifies players with results in multiple non-online scenes, flagging potential name collisions for review.
- **Player split fix script**: `scripts/analysis/fix_cross_scene_duplicates.R` splits incorrectly merged players, clears Bandai IDs from both sides, and generates Discord notification messages for scene admins.
- **Scene-scoped player matching**: `match_player()` function now accepts optional `scene_id` parameter. When provided, name-only lookups are scoped to players who have results in that scene.
- **Helper function**: `get_store_scene_id()` in `R/admin_grid.R` retrieves scene_id for a given store.

### Technical
- Updated player matching in `admin-results-server.R`, `admin-tournaments-server.R`, and `public-submit-server.R` to pass scene context
- Initial analysis identified 7 players incorrectly merged across distant scenes (DFW↔Pennsylvania, DFW↔Denmark, etc.)

---

## [1.1.1] - 2026-02-28 - Tournament Query Fix

### Fixed
- **Duplicate tournament rows**: Tournaments with multiple tied first-place finishers (from Limitless Swiss events) caused duplicate rows in the Tournaments tab, Recent Tournaments table, and Store detail view. Replaced `LEFT JOIN results` with `LEFT JOIN LATERAL ... LIMIT 1` to guarantee one row per tournament across 4 queries.

---

## [1.1.0] - 2026-02-28 - Discord Integration & Error Reporting

### Added
- **Discord webhook system**: New `R/discord_webhook.R` module with fire-and-forget webhook posting. Three webhook bots with Digimon-themed names: Veemon (scene requests), Gatomon (scene coordination), Tentomon (bug reports).
- **Store/scene request modals**: In-app modals replace Google Form for requesting new stores and scenes. Requests route to Discord scene coordination threads or a `#scene-requests` Forum channel based on context.
- **Data error reporting**: Contextual "Report Error" buttons in player, tournament, and deck meta modals. Reports route to the relevant scene's Discord coordination thread with item context (type, name, description). Falls back to bug reports channel if no scene thread is configured.
- **Bug report modal**: General bug reporting via footer link and content pages. Creates Forum posts in `#bug-reports` Discord channel with auto-applied "New" tag, app context (current tab, scene), and optional Discord username.
- **Admin scenes enhancements**: Discord thread ID, country, and state/region fields on scenes. Reverse geocoding via Mapbox for auto-populating geo metadata. Confirmation dialog when editing scenes to prevent accidental overwrites.
- **Scene backfill script**: `scripts/backfill_scenes.py` to populate country/state_region from scene coordinates.

### Changed
- **For Organizers page**: Rewrote "Report an Error" section with data error guidance and bug report trigger. All accordions collapsed by default. All contact button groups centered.
- **FAQ page**: "I found a bug" section now opens bug report modal instead of linking to Discord. "Can I get my data corrected" section includes data error report button. All contact button groups centered.
- **Report Error buttons**: Replaced static Discord links in player, tournament, and deck modals with webhook-powered actionButtons styled as `btn-outline-warning` (amber).
- **Content page buttons**: Centered all contact link groups across FAQ and For Organizers pages using `contact-links--centered` CSS modifier.

### Fixed
- **Connection pool retry logic**: Expanded retry patterns to catch additional transient PostgreSQL connection errors beyond prepared statement conflicts.
- **SQL column name bug**: Fixed `s.store_name` → `s.name as store_name` in tournament error report query (stores table column is `name`, not `store_name`).
- **Modal input persistence**: Added input clearing (`updateTextAreaInput`/`updateTextInput`) before showing error report and bug report modals to prevent stale data from previous submissions.
- **Mapbox geocode Referer header**: Added required `Referer` header to Mapbox API calls.
- **Reactable date warning**: Converted `created_at` to text in SQL to prevent reactable date column warnings in admin scenes table.
- **Webhook error handling**: Fixed `pool::dbGetQuery` usage in webhook module, store request button visibility, and action button icon rendering.

### Technical
- Discord webhooks use Forum API (`thread_name`, `applied_tags`) for bug reports and scene requests
- Scene coordination uses thread-based routing via `discord_thread_id` on scenes table
- Environment variables: `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_BUG_REPORTS`, `DISCORD_TAG_NEW_BUG`, `DISCORD_WEBHOOK_SCENE_REQUESTS`, `DISCORD_TAG_NEW_REQUEST`
- Webhook errors logged to Sentry but never block the user (fire-and-forget pattern)

---

## [1.0.9] - 2026-02-26 - Database Connection Stability

### Fixed
- **Prepared statement pooling errors**: Added retry logic to `safe_query()` and `safe_execute()` for transient PostgreSQL prepared statement cache conflicts. Errors like "Query requires 1 params; 8 supplied" and "unnamed prepared statement does not exist" now automatically retry once, which typically succeeds as the connection pool assigns a fresh connection.
- **Dashboard card image null checks**: Added `length() == 0` guards before `is.na()` checks in dashboard card image rendering. Prevents "argument is of length zero" errors when deck archetypes have no display card configured.
- **OCR text null handling**: Added `!is.na()` check before string comparison in OCR processing. Prevents "missing value where TRUE/FALSE needed" errors when Vision API returns NA.

### Technical
- Retry logic detects errors containing "prepared statement" or "bind message supplies"
- Brief 100ms pause between retry attempts to allow connection pool state to settle
- All fixes identified via Sentry error monitoring

---

## [1.0.8] - 2026-02-25 - Limitless Integration Fixes

### Fixed
- **Duplicate key error when adding results**: The Limitless sync script was manually calculating IDs instead of letting PostgreSQL auto-generate them, causing the database sequence to get out of sync. Fixed sync script to use `INSERT ... RETURNING` pattern.
- **Edit Results grid showing only 8 rows**: When editing a tournament with more than 8 expected players, the grid was hardcoded to show only 8 rows if no results were saved yet. Now correctly shows rows matching the tournament's player count.
- **Decklist URLs**: Fixed 1,838 broken decklist links. URLs now correctly point to `play.limitlesstcg.com/tournament/{id}/player/{username}/decklist` instead of the incorrect format.
- **Egg category parsing**: Classification now correctly reads `'egg'` category from Limitless API (was looking for `'digi-egg'`).
- **Classification rules**: Major overhaul of 25+ deck archetype rules based on actual meta:
  - Blastmon split into Bagra Army vs Rocks (based on boss monsters)
  - Insectoids renamed to Royal Base
  - Galaxy updated with correct cards (Lunamon/Coronamon/Apollomon)
  - Royal Knights rule fixed (was matching Omnimon decks)
  - Added CS Omnimon vs DNA Omnimon distinction (Nokia tamer check)
  - Many other corrections and new variants

### Added
- **Classification review workflow**: Unknown/unclassifiable decks now create `deck_requests` for admin review instead of being silently skipped.
- **View Decklist button**: Admins can now view the full card list for deck requests in a modal.
- **Assign to existing archetype**: When reviewing deck requests, admins can now assign to an existing archetype instead of only creating new ones.
- **Source tracking**: Deck requests now track their source (`manual`, `limitless_sync`, `classification`).
- **New classification rules**: Added rules for ExMaquinamon, Ice-Snow, Dark Animals, Hina Linkz, Dark Masters, Appmon variants (Poseidomon, Galacticmon), Sistermon Puppets, and more.
- **Appmon archetype**: New archetype for generic Appmon decks.

### Changed
- **Deck requests query**: Admin deck requests section now shows both `pending` and `needs_classification` status requests.
- **Edit & Approve modal**: Now shows suggested archetype name and offers dropdown to assign to existing archetypes.

---

## [1.0.7] - 2026-02-25 - Deck Request UX & Dashboard Improvements

### Fixed
- **Deck request modal lockout**: Submitting a new deck request in the Upload Results tab would freeze the modal, requiring a page refresh. The modal now closes immediately and dropdown updates happen asynchronously.

### Added
- **Deck suggestion feature**: When requesting a new deck, similar existing decks are now shown as suggestions (e.g., typing "Vortexdramon" shows "Vortex Warriors"). Helps prevent duplicate deck requests. Added to both public Upload Results and admin Enter Results tabs.
- **Scene column in Recent Tournaments**: When viewing "All Scenes", the Recent Tournaments table now shows which scene each tournament belongs to.
- **Dynamic conversion threshold**: Top 3 Conversion chart now requires minimum 10 entries when viewing "All Scenes" (was 2) for statistical significance. Specific scenes require minimum 3 entries.
- **Threshold note in header**: The minimum entries requirement is displayed in the card header (e.g., "Min. 10 entries") instead of inside the chart.

### Changed
- **Deck suggestions debounced**: 300ms debounce on deck name input prevents inconsistent suggestion behavior during fast typing.
- **Suggestion box styling**: Uses DigiLab's `info-hint-box` styling with digital grid pattern instead of generic Bootstrap alert.

---

## [1.0.6] - 2026-02-24 - Member Number Management Fix

### Fixed
- **Member number editing**: Admins can now edit member numbers directly from the Edit Players form
- **Member number saved from results grid**: Entering a member number in the tournament results grid now persists it to the player record
- **Member number auto-populates**: When a matched player already has a member number, the results grid auto-fills it
- **Merge preserves member numbers**: Merging players now transfers the source's member number to the target (if target doesn't have one)
- **Inactive player matching**: Soft-deleted players no longer match during player resolution, fixing "poisoned player" entries that couldn't be removed
- **Cross-scene collision prevention**: Player matching now checks member number first (when provided) before falling back to name matching

---

## [1.0.5] - 2026-02-24 - Global Map Improvements

### Added
- **All Scenes world map**: "All Scenes" now shows a flat mercator world map with both physical stores (orange) and online organizers (green) for full ecosystem coverage
- **Onboarding world map**: Scene picker modal now uses flat mercator projection with taller map (300px) for better global visibility

### Changed
- **Regional zoom cap**: Regional scene maps capped at zoom level 9 so scenes with few stores (e.g., Vancouver, Wellington) show geographic context instead of being zoomed in too tight
- **Map container height**: Stores tab map increased from 400px to 475px for better world map framing
- **Map center/zoom**: All Scenes and onboarding maps centered at equator level with zoom 1.2 for full global coverage including New Zealand and South America

---

## [1.0.4] - 2026-02-24 - Dynamic Min Events & Ko-fi Update

### Added
- **Dynamic min events default**: The "Min Events" filter on Players tab and "Min Entries" filter on Deck Meta tab now default based on scene tournament count
  - Scenes with <20 tournaments default to "All" (show everyone)
  - Scenes with 20-100 tournaments default to "5+"
  - Scenes with >100 tournaments default to "10+"
  - Ensures newer scenes don't appear empty while established scenes surface committed competitors
- **Help tooltips**: Added info icons next to min events/entries filters explaining the dynamic behavior
- **FAQ entry**: New FAQ explaining why the filter defaults differ between scenes

### Changed
- **Ko-fi link**: Updated from atomshell to digilab (https://ko-fi.com/digilab)

---

## [1.0.3] - 2026-02-24 - Admin Tab Dropdown & Player Edit Fixes

### Fixed
- **Admin tab dropdowns not populating on first visit**: Lazy-loaded admin tabs (Manage Admins, Edit Stores, Edit Tournaments, Enter Results) had dropdowns that appeared empty on first navigation
  - Root cause: `session$onFlushed()` wasn't sufficient because UI doesn't exist until after `renderUI()` completes
  - Solution: Use `invalidateLater(100)` polling pattern to retry until UI exists
  - For modal dropdowns (merge players, merge decks), populate choices when modal opens instead of via observer
  - Split public/admin format dropdown observers since public tabs are not lazy-loaded
- **Player name edit in View/Edit Results blanking member number**: Editing a player's name was creating a new player record instead of updating the existing one
  - Now correctly updates the original player's `display_name` while preserving `member_number` and other data

### Changed
- **Improved error logging**: `safe_query()` now includes 500-char query preview and parameters in Sentry error reports for easier debugging
- **Navbar version badge**: Now dynamically uses `APP_VERSION` variable instead of hardcoded string

---

## [1.0.2] - 2026-02-24 - Dropdown Selection Fix

### Fixed
- **Admin form dropdown selections silently resetting**: Observers that repopulate dropdown choices on data refresh were not preserving the current selection, causing data loss when users saved forms after a background refresh
  - Fixed in 7 locations: store scene, tournament store/format, user scene, results wizard store/format, player merge, deck merge
  - All affected observers now use `isolate(input$...)` to preserve selections

---

## v1.1.0 - Database Migration (Neon PostgreSQL)

### Changed
- Migrated from DuckDB/MotherDuck to Neon PostgreSQL as the single database for all environments
- R connection layer now uses `pool` + `RPostgres` instead of `duckdb` package
- Simplified `safe_query()`/`safe_execute()` — removed retry/reconnect logic (no longer needed)
- Replaced `next_id()` MAX+1 pattern with PostgreSQL `INSERT ... RETURNING`
- Transaction blocks use `pool::localCheckout()` for proper isolation
- Python sync scripts (`sync_cards.py`, `sync_limitless.py`) rewritten for `psycopg2`
- GitHub Actions workflows use Neon env vars instead of MotherDuck token
- SQL placeholders converted from `?` to `$N` (RPostgres requirement)

### Added
- `db/schema_postgres.sql` (now `db/schema.sql`) — PostgreSQL schema with auto-increment IDs
- Foreign key constraints restored (15 relationships with CASCADE/RESTRICT/SET NULL)
- `scripts/migrate_to_neon.py` — one-time DuckDB → Neon data migration tool
- `pool` and `RPostgres` R package dependencies

### Removed
- `scripts/sync_to_motherduck.py` — no longer needed (single database)
- `scripts/sync_from_motherduck.py` — no longer needed
- `scripts/drop_fk_constraints.py` — FK constraints now work properly in Postgres
- MotherDuck connection logic (`connect_motherduck()`, `can_use_motherduck()`)
- DuckDB package dependency from production app
- `rv$db_con` reactive value — replaced by `db_pool` global

---

## [1.0.1] - 2026-02-23 - International Store Support

### Added
- **International Store Addresses**: Physical stores now support worldwide addresses
  - Full ~195 country dropdown (via `countrycode` package) with type-to-search on both physical and online store forms
  - Free-text "State / Province" field replaces hardcoded US state dropdown
  - "ZIP Code" renamed to "Postal Code" for international compatibility
  - Geocoding address string now includes country for better Mapbox accuracy
- **`R/constants.R`**: Shared constants file with `COUNTRY_CHOICES` list

### Changed
- **Online store country selector**: Upgraded from 6-item list to full country list
- **DB schema**: Removed `DEFAULT 'TX'` from `state` column (no migration needed)

### Dependencies
- Added `countrycode` 1.6.1 (ISO country names)

---

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-23 - Public Launch

### Added
- **Enter/Submit Results Parity (ADM2)**: Migrated public Upload Results review grid to shared grid module from Enter Results
  - Member # column in shared grid (visible in both admin and public flows)
  - Searchable selectize deck dropdown replaces static select in both tabs
  - OCR quality validation with warning modal (proceed anyway / re-upload)
  - Blur-based player matching on public submit review grid
  - Entry vs review mode CSS for OCR-populated rows (subtle blue highlight)
  - Format and event type shown in both summary bars
  - Event types synced to shared `EVENT_TYPES` constant
  - Admin form validation (event type, format) and field reset after submit
- **Progressive Web App (PWA1)**: App is now installable ("Add to Home Screen") on mobile and desktop
  - Web app manifest with Digivice icons (192/512 standard + maskable) and dark theme
  - Offline-only service worker serves Agumon fallback page when network is unavailable
  - Favicon (`www/favicon.ico`) and Apple touch icon from Digivice SVG
  - `mobile-web-app-capable` meta tag for standalone mode on iOS/Android
- **Agumon Loading Spinner (DM9)**: Agumon SVG centered inside the circular loading gate animation with `gate-agumon-pulse` scale/opacity animation
- **Agumon Disconnect Overlay (DM3)**: Agumon SVG in the "Connection Lost" reconnect screen with `disconnect-agumon` bounce animation
- **Agumon 404 Not Found (DM7)**: Bad deep link URLs now show a modal with Agumon mascot, entity-specific title, and descriptive message instead of a toast notification
- **Digivice OG Image (DM11)**: New 1200x630 Open Graph image (`www/og-image.svg` / `og-image.png`) with large Digivice watermark behind DigiLab text
- **Digivice Logo Refresh (DM10)**: Updated `docs/digilab-logo.svg` and `docs/digilab-icon.svg` with Digivice icon
- **Mobile Column Hiding**: Stores table hides City, Avg Event Size, Avg Rating on mobile; admin tournaments table hides Type, Format, Rounds
- **Performance Profiling**: Load tested with shinycannon (1/5/10/25 concurrent users), profiled with profvis
- **Lazy Admin UI**: Admin views (`renderUI`) only generated when user authenticates as admin — reduces initial page weight for public visitors
- **Extended bindCache**: Added `bindCache()` to Players, Meta, Tournaments, and Stores tab outputs for cross-session caching
- **Responsive Top Decks & Rising Stars**: Dashboard grids show 4/6/8 items based on screen size (CSS nth-child breakpoints at 1600px/991px/640px)
- **Rising Stars Top 6**: Expanded from 4 to 6 players (up to 8 on large screens)
- **"Report Error" Buttons**: Styled button in player, meta, tournament, and store modal footers linking to Google Form
- **Clickable DigiLab Header**: App title navigates back to Dashboard
- **`next_id()` Helper**: Atomic ID generation replacing `SELECT MAX(id) + 1` pattern
- **`format_event_type()` Shared Helper**: Centralized event type display formatting (was duplicated 4x)
- **Browser Credential Saving**: Login, bootstrap, and change password forms wrapped in `<form>` tags with `autocomplete` attributes for browser password managers
- **iframe Permissions**: Added `clipboard-write` and `geolocation` to iframe `allow` attribute on digilab.cards

### Changed
- **Version Badge**: BETA badge replaced with "v1.0" version indicator
- **Sentry Version Tag**: Now reads from `APP_VERSION` variable instead of hardcoded string
- **Dashboard Value Boxes**: `total_stores_val` and `total_decks_val` now respect format/event type/scene filters and use `bindCache()`
- **Dashboard Filters**: `build_dashboard_filters()` and `build_community_filters()` refactored to delegate to shared `build_filters_param()`
- **OG Meta Tags**: Updated to reference `og-image.png` with dimensions, Twitter card upgraded to `summary_large_image`
- **Admin Layout Breakpoints (MOB1)**: All 8 admin and dashboard `layout_columns` calls now use `breakpoints()` for proper mobile stacking
- **Admin Results Mobile (MOB1)**: All `col-md-X` classes now include `col-12` prefix for mobile-first stacking
- **Tab Bar Tap Targets (MOB1)**: Increased mobile tab bar item padding and added `min-width: 44px` / `min-height: 44px` for WCAG compliance
- **Value Box Font Floor (MOB1)**: Bumped `.vb-label` and `.vb-subtitle` minimum font sizes at 576px breakpoint from 0.55/0.6rem to 0.65rem

### Security
- **Public Submit Server Hardened**: All 28 raw `dbGetQuery`/`dbExecute` calls migrated to `safe_query()`/`safe_execute()` wrappers
- **Transaction Safety**: Tournament and match history submissions wrapped in `BEGIN TRANSACTION`/`COMMIT`/`ROLLBACK`; write operations inside transactions use `DBI::dbExecute()` directly (not `safe_execute()`) so errors propagate and trigger clean rollback
- **OCR Sanity Check**: Prevents username numbers (e.g., "Legobuilder96") from inflating player count — caps max_rank when wildly disproportionate to parsed row count
- **Blank Row Filtering**: Public submission path now filters empty rows before database insert (matches admin path behavior)
- **ID Race Condition Fix**: Replaced `SELECT MAX(id) + 1` with `next_id()` helper in submit and admin-results servers
- **XSS Fix**: Scene map popup HTML now uses `htmltools::htmlEscape()` on user-facing names

### Fixed
- **Lazy-Loaded Admin Dropdowns**: Added `rv$current_nav` dependency to 4 observe blocks that populate dropdowns in lazy-loaded admin UI — scene assignment, store/format, merge deck, and merge player dropdowns were empty because `updateSelectInput` fired before the input existed in the DOM
- **Transaction Error Reporting**: Added Sentry reporting and logging to public submission transaction error handler
- **Agumon SVG Scope Bug**: `agumonSvg` variable was scoped inside `$(document).ready()`, causing `ReferenceError` in disconnect overlay IIFE — hoisted to outer scope
- **Agumon SVG Color/Size Swap**: `agumon_svg()` sprintf args were in wrong order (`size, size, color` instead of `color, size, size`), putting color value into height attribute
- **Tournament Modal Store Link**: Removed clickable store name (was navigating away from modal context)

### Removed
- Duplicate `www/digilab-logo.svg` (original lives in `docs/`)
- `.loading-character` CSS class and `character-jump` animation (replaced by Agumon in loading gate)
- 4 duplicated `format_event_type()` implementations (now shared from `shared-server.R`)

## [0.29.0] - 2026-02-22 - Admin Auth & Automation

## [0.28.0] - 2026-02-22 - Content Updates, Error Tracking & Admin UX

### Added
- **OCR Layout-Aware Parser**: Replaced line-based text parsing with bounding box coordinate analysis using Google Cloud Vision annotations (73% → 95% accuracy)
  - `parse_standings_layout()`: 12-step algorithm normalizes coordinates, clusters rows by Y-position, assigns text to columns (Ranking, Username/Member, Win Points) by X-position
  - `parse_standings()` orchestrator: tries layout parser first, validates results, falls back to text parser
  - Medal icon rank inference: detects missing ranks 1-3 (gold/silver/bronze icons unreadable by GCV) and infers from Y-position ordering
  - Points validation: caps at `rounds * 3`, truncates merged digits (GCV sometimes merges "6" + "0" from adjacent OMW% column)
  - Noise filtering: app headers, B-logo variants, copyright fragments, garbled multi-word text without member numbers
  - `gcv_detect_text()` now returns bounding box annotations alongside full text for backward compatibility
  - Ranking-aware multi-screenshot merge with GUEST dedup and rank gap padding
  - GUEST player DB lookup: recovers real member numbers by matching username against players table
- **OCR Batch Test Harness**: `batch_test_folders()` and `batch_retest_folders()` in `scripts/batch_test_ocr.R` — 7 ground truth folders (11 screenshots, 106 expected players) with per-field accuracy scoring
- **LINKS Constant**: Centralized all external URLs (Discord, Ko-fi, GitHub, contact form) into a `LINKS` list in `app.R` — all views reference `LINKS$discord`, `LINKS$kofi`, etc.
- **FAQ Page Rewrite**: 5 categories (Getting Started, Ratings & Scores, Scenes & Regions, Data & Coverage, General), 22 questions covering all features through v0.27
- **About Page Rewrite**: Removed DFW-specific language, added "Active Scenes" stat with globe icon, Discord as primary contact link, multi-region audience types (Online Competitors, Community Builders)
- **For Organizers Page Rewrite**: New Limitless Integration section (3 panels), Community Links section (3 panels), split store submission into Physical/Online/Requirements, replaced GitHub with Discord for scene requests
- **Sentry Error Tracking**: `sentryR` integration with `SENTRY_DSN` env var — captures exceptions in `safe_query()`/`safe_execute()` and global Shiny error handler, with graceful no-op when not configured
- **Admin Info Hint Boxes**: Added to Enter Results, Edit Tournaments, and Edit Players (all 6 admin pages now have consistent help text)
- **Record Format Help Text**: Inline explanation below radio buttons ("Points: Total match points... W-L-T: Individual wins, losses, and ties")

- **`skeleton_table()` / `skeleton_chart()` Helpers**: Reusable skeleton loader generators for table and chart card bodies
- **`admin_empty_state()` Helper**: Lightweight empty state variant for admin tables with consistent digital styling
- **Filter-Aware Empty States**: Public tables (Players, Meta, Tournaments) now show "No X match your filters" with funnel icon when filters are active, vs Agumon mascot "No data" when genuinely empty
- **`notify()` Smart Durations**: Wrapper around `showNotification()` — errors stick until dismissed, warnings last 8s, success messages last 4s
- **Digital Grid on All Card Headers**: Subtle grid pattern (Tier 2, 0.025 opacity) applied to all card headers, with stronger pattern (Tier 1, 0.04 opacity) on chart/feature cards
- **Circuit Node on All Card Headers**: Small cyan accent dot on all card headers (4px Tier 2), with larger dot (5px Tier 1) on chart/feature cards
- **Modal Body Grid Texture**: Very subtle digital grid overlay (0.015 opacity) on all modal bodies
- **Inline Form Validation**: Red border + glow on invalid fields across all 14 admin form handlers with auto-clear on user interaction
- **`show_field_error()` / `clear_field_error()` / `clear_all_field_errors()` Helpers**: Inline validation helpers using shinyjs
- **Debounced Search Inputs**: 300ms debounce on all 5 search inputs (Players, Meta, Tournaments, Admin Tournaments, Admin Players)
- **Value Box Count-Up Animation**: Numeric value boxes (Tournaments, Players) animate from old to new value with cubic ease-out; deck boxes fade in on update

### Changed
- **US States Dropdown**: Edit Stores state selection expanded from TX-only to all 50 US states + DC with `selectize = FALSE`

- **Cross-Page Navigation**: All 11 sidebar navigation handlers now update sidebar selection via `sendCustomMessage("updateSidebarNav", ...)`

- **Tournament Results Editor**: Nested edit/delete modals now use re-show pattern (Shiny only supports one modal at a time)
- **Error Notifications Persistent**: Error toasts no longer auto-dismiss — user must click X to close
- **Admin Empty States Styled**: Admin formats and players tables now use `admin_empty_state()` instead of plain text reactable rows

### Removed
- Debug `message()` calls from `admin-decks-server.R` (UPDATE/DELETE archetype logging) and verbose file processing logs from `public-submit-server.R`
- Orphaned `about_result_count` server output and `faq_to_about` navigation handler
- ~270 lines of static Bootstrap modal HTML from 6 admin view files
- All jQuery `modal('show'/'hide')` calls from server files
