## 2026-02-22: UX Polish Round 2 — Items 6, 8, 14

### Changes Made

**Inline Form Validation (Item 6):**
- CSS `.input-invalid` class with red border + box-shadow (light and dark mode)
- `show_field_error(session, inputId)`, `clear_field_error(session, inputId)`, `clear_all_field_errors(session)` R helpers using shinyjs
- Auto-clear JS handler: invalid styling clears on change/input/focus events
- Applied to all 14 admin form submission handlers across 6 server files
- No new packages — uses shinyjs (already loaded) + CSS classes

**Debounced Search Inputs (Item 8):**
- 300ms `reactive() |> debounce(300)` on all 5 search inputs
- Public: `players_search_debounced`, `meta_search_debounced`, `tournaments_search_debounced`
- Admin: `admin_tournament_search_debounced`, `player_search_debounced`
- Only READ references replaced; WRITE references (updateTextInput) unchanged

**Value Box Animations (Item 14):**
- Count-up: `requestAnimationFrame` loop with cubic ease-out, 600ms duration, for Tournaments and Players numeric boxes
- Fade-in: CSS `.vb-value-updating` class with 0.4s ease-out animation for deck content boxes
- Both integrated into existing `shiny:value` event handler (no separate listener)
- First load uses fade-in (oldVal === 0); subsequent updates count up

## 2026-02-21: UX Polish — Items 1-5

### Changes Made

**Loading Indicators:**
- Added CSS skeleton loaders with digital shimmer animation (light + dark mode)
- `skeleton_table(rows)` and `skeleton_chart(bars, height)` R helpers in app.R
- Skeleton divs on 3 public table views + 7 dashboard outputs, auto-hidden via `shiny:value` JS event
- `.recalculating` class fades outputs to 40% opacity while Shiny recalculates

**Empty State Standardization:**
- `admin_empty_state()` helper — lightweight variant of `digital_empty_state()` for admin tables
- Replaced plain `reactable(data.frame(Message = "..."))` empty rows in admin-formats and admin-players
- Public pages (Players, Meta, Tournaments) now show filter-aware messages: "No X match your filters" with funnel icon when filters active, vs Agumon mascot when genuinely empty

**Digital Aesthetic Extension:**
- All card headers now get subtle grid pattern (Tier 2: 0.025 opacity vs feature cards' 0.04)
- All card headers now get small circuit node accent (Tier 2: 4px vs feature cards' 5px)
- Modal bodies get very subtle grid texture (0.015 opacity)
- Creates visual continuity between themed chrome and content area

**Notification System:**
- `notify()` wrapper replaces all 175 `showNotification()` calls across 11 server files
- Smart duration defaults: errors = sticky (NULL), warnings = 8s, messages = 4s
- Existing explicit `duration` params preserved — wrapper only applies defaults when duration is NULL

**Modal Consolidation:**
- Migrated all 8 static Bootstrap modals to Shiny's `showModal()`/`removeModal()` pattern
- Removed ~270 lines of boilerplate `tags$div(class = "modal fade", ...)` HTML from 6 view files
- Replaced all jQuery `$('#id').modal('show'/'hide')` calls in server files
- Tournament results editor uses helper function `show_results_editor()` for re-show after nested edit/delete

### Technical Notes

- Shiny's `showModal()` only supports one modal at a time — calling it replaces the current modal. This required the re-show pattern for the tournament results editor's nested modals.
- The `notify()` wrapper merges with the existing custom notification system (icon + message layout) — it doesn't replace the HTML structure, just adds smart duration logic.
- CSS card header grid uses `background-image` with `repeating-linear-gradient` — the `!important` is needed to override Bootstrap defaults.
- Skeleton loaders use a single `shiny:value` event handler that maps `event.name + '_skeleton'` to find and hide matching skeleton divs.

## 2026-02-20: Stores & Filtering Features (v0.25.0)

### Changes Made

**Online Organizers Display:**
- World map with region-level markers when "Online" scene selected
- Added `country` column to stores table for international support
- New "Cards" view replaces "All Stores" table - consistent across all scenes
- `R/geo_utils.R` provides coordinate lookup for country/region combinations
- Consolidated store modals: single modal handles both physical and online stores
- Online store mini maps show region location (zoom level 3, green marker)

**Community Links:**
- `?community=store-slug` URL parameter filters entire app to single store
- Banner appears when filter active with "View All" to clear
- "Share Community View" button in store modals
- All public tabs (Dashboard, Players, Meta, Tournaments) respect filter
- Auto-switches Players/Meta pill toggles to "All" when community filter active (small datasets)
- Resets to "5+" when community filter cleared

**Admin Scene Filtering:**
- Admin tables (Players, Tournaments, Stores) now respect scene selection
- Super admins have "Show all scenes" toggle to override
- Players filtered by where they've competed (EXISTS subquery pattern)

### Technical Notes

- Community filter takes precedence over scene filter in queries
- Used `build_dashboard_filters` and `build_community_filters` pattern
- `bindCache` calls updated to include `rv$community_filter`
- Admin filtering uses direct scene_id comparison for stores/tournaments, EXISTS subquery for players
- Removed separate `online_store_detail_modal` in favor of unified `store_detail_modal`
- Mini map renderer checks `coords$is_online` to determine zoom level and marker color
- Pill toggle reset via `session$sendCustomMessage("setPillToggle", ...)` custom handler

## 2026-02-19: Deck Merge Tool & Admin Table Fixes

**Context:** After bulk-syncing Limitless data, many similar deck archetypes needed consolidation (e.g., "Virus Imperialdramon" vs "Imperialdramon (RP)"). Also fixed admin table interaction bugs.

**What was built:**
- **Deck Archetype Merge Tool** (`views/admin-decks-ui.R`, `server/admin-decks-server.R`):
  - New "Merge Decks" button and modal in Edit Decks admin tab
  - Source/target deck selection with result count preview
  - On merge: moves all results to target deck, updates `limitless_deck_map` entries, deletes source archetype
  - Pattern mirrors existing player merge tool

**Bugs fixed:**
- **Row selection mismatch**: Clicking a row in Edit Decks or Edit Stores sometimes returned wrong data. Root cause: client-side column sorting caused index mismatch with server-side query order. Fix: Added `sortable = FALSE` to both reactable tables.
- **Table not refreshing after merge**: Archetype list didn't update after merge. Fix: Added `input$confirm_merge_decks` and `rv$data_refresh` to reactable render triggers.

**Data cleanup:**
- Changed 158 results from NULL archetype to UNKNOWN (archetype_id = 50)
- Current online data quality: 45/151 (29.8%) online tournaments have UNKNOWN 1st place deck
  - PHOENIX REBORN: 30/93 (32%)
  - Eagle's Nest: 9/33 (27%)
  - dK's Tournament: 4/8 (50%)
  - MasterRukasu: 2/4 (50%)
  - DMV Drakes: 0/6 (0%) — complete deck data

## 2026-02-19: Limitless Integration — Phase 1 Implementation

**Context:** Implemented Phase 1 of the Limitless TCG integration (design doc: `docs/plans/2026-02-19-limitless-integration-design.md`).

**What was built:**
- `db/schema.sql` v1.4.0: Added `limitless_organizer_id` to stores, new `limitless_deck_map` and `limitless_sync_state` tables
- `db/migrations/002_limitless_integration.sql`: Migration for existing databases
- `scripts/sync_limitless.py` (943 lines): Full CLI sync tool — fetches tournaments, standings, pairings from Limitless API, resolves players, maps decks, infers formats, inserts results/matches
- Enhanced player merge tool: Now transfers matches (player + opponent), copies `limitless_username`, handles UNIQUE conflicts on results
- Updated `sync_from_motherduck.py` and `sync_to_motherduck.py` with new table names

**Initial sync results (partial — PHOENIX REBORN still has ~13 remaining due to rate limits):**
- Eagle's Nest (452): 35/35 tournaments synced (3 missing pairings from rate limits)
- PHOENIX REBORN (281): 52/65 tournaments synced
- DMV Drakes (559): 6/7 tournaments synced (1 Unicode error, data saved)
- MasterRukasu (578): 4/4 tournaments synced
- Totals: ~97 tournaments, ~1,700+ results, ~5,600+ matches, ~400+ new players, ~85 deck requests

**Rate limiting lessons:**
- Limitless API has aggressive rate limits without an API key
- Bumped `REQUEST_DELAY` from 0.5s to 1.5s; still hit 429s on bulk syncs
- Idempotent design means re-runs cleanly pick up where they left off
- Tournaments with partial data (inserted but missing pairings/standings due to 429) need a "repair" mechanism in the future

**Remaining work:**
- Finish PHOENIX REBORN sync (re-run to pick up ~13 remaining tournaments)
- Fill in missing pairings for tournaments that 429'd mid-sync
- Map 85+ deck requests in admin panel
- Recalculate ratings with new tournament data
- Phase 2: GitHub Actions workflow for daily automated sync

**Branch:** `feature/limitless-integration`

## 2026-02-19: Limitless TCG API Integration Research

**Context:** Explored using the [LimitlessTCG API](https://docs.limitlesstcg.com/developer/) to automatically ingest online Digimon tournament data into DigiLab's Online scene, replacing manual data entry for online organizers.

**Findings:**
- Limitless has ~2,500+ DCG tournaments dating back to mid-2022, but data quality varies by organizer
- The `format` field is always null for DCG — must be inferred from tournament name (regex) or release date fallback
- Deck archetype and full decklists are only available when organizers set `decklists: true`
- Audited 20 DCG organizers: 8 have full deck data, 12 do not
- 4 Tier 1 organizers identified for launch: Eagle's Nest (452, USA), PHOENIX REBORN (281, Argentina), DMV Drakes (559, USA), MasterRukasu (578, Brazil)

**Key design decisions:**
- Limitless organizer = DigiLab virtual store (`is_online = TRUE`, Online scene)
- All synced tournaments use `event_type = "online"`
- Online tournaments feed the same Elo rating pool as locals (no separation)
- Unmapped Limitless deck IDs route through existing `deck_requests` queue for admin review
- New `limitless_deck_map` table for one-time archetype mapping per Limitless deck ID
- Players auto-created from Limitless display name + username; existing merge tool handles duplicates
- Match pairings synced to `matches` table (`match_points` derived from winner, game scores NULL)
- Not storing card-by-card decklists for now (no UI/feature plan)
- Sync via Python script locally (Phase 1), then GitHub Actions daily cron (Phase 2) — mirrors existing `sync-cards.yml` pattern
- Historical sync depth: BT23 era onward (~Oct 2025)

**API key:** Requested from Limitless (pending approval). Not required for basic access but needed for higher rate limits and deck classification rules endpoint.

**Design doc:** `docs/plans/2026-02-19-limitless-integration-design.md`

## 2026-02-19: Admin Grid Entry

**Problem:** Adding 16+ players via the admin Enter Results tab required 16+ cycles of select-player, select-deck, enter-WLT, click-Add. Non-Bandai sources sometimes provide total points instead of W-L-T records, requiring mental conversion.

**Solution:** Replaced one-at-a-time entry with a full-width editable grid. N blank rows (based on player count) appear after tournament creation. Admins type directly into the grid, see inline player match feedback, and submit all results at once.

**Key decisions:**
- Record Format toggle at tournament level: Points mode auto-converts to W-L-T on submit (`wins = pts / 3`, `ties = pts % 3`, `losses = rounds - wins - ties`)
- Player matching: exact case-insensitive name match on blur, auto-create new players on submit
- Paste from Spreadsheet: auto-detects format (names only, name+points, name+W+L+T)
- Deck request modal reuses the pattern from Upload Results tab
- Grid replaces old flow entirely (no toggle back)
- Edit/delete after submission stays in Edit Tournaments tab

---
## 2026-02-19: Upload Results Row Management Fix

**Problem:** OCR sometimes creates more rows than `total_players` because the truncation logic filtered by placement value (`combined$placement <= total_players`) instead of position. Duplicate placements let extra rows through. No way to delete spurious rows.

**Solution:**
- Changed truncation to positional: `combined[1:total_players, ]` after sort
- Added delete button per row in review table with auto-renumber
- Added input sync helper that reads current form values back into `rv$submit_ocr_results` before mutations so edits survive re-renders
- Delete pads with blank row at bottom to maintain `total_players` count

## 2026-02-18: Dashboard Polish, Release Events & Mobile Navbar

### Summary
Continued v0.23 polish on the `develop` branch. Three areas: dashboard chart/layout improvements, release event handling for sealed-pack tournaments, and mobile navbar responsiveness.

### Key Technical Decisions

**Meta Share percent stacking:** The Meta Share Over Time chart was pre-calculating percentages with `round(..., 1)`, which caused rounding errors where weekly shares didn't always sum to exactly 100%. Switched to passing raw entry counts with Highcharts `stacking = "percent"` — Highcharts auto-normalizes to 100% internally. Tooltip uses `point.percentage` (available in percent stacking mode) instead of `point.y`.

**Cross-tab modal rendering:** Clicking dashboard items (Top Decks, Rising Stars, Recent Tournaments) previously switched tabs then opened modals. Changed to open modals in-place on the dashboard. This required `outputOptions(output, "..._detail_modal", suspendWhenHidden = FALSE)` on all three modal renderUI outputs — Shiny suspends uiOutput on hidden tabs by default, so modals wouldn't render without this.

**Release event UNKNOWN auto-assign:** Release events use sealed packs, so deck archetype is meaningless. Rather than filtering UNKNOWN from every meta query (most already exclude it), the cleanest fix was at the entry point: auto-assign UNKNOWN archetype when `event_type == "release_event"`, hide the deck selector, and show an info notice. Server looks up UNKNOWN archetype_id via DB query at entry time.

**Mobile navbar flex-wrap:** Moved scene selector and dark mode toggle from inside `header-actions` to direct children of `.app-header`. This allows CSS `flex-wrap: wrap` with `order` to push the scene selector to a full-width row on mobile (<768px) while keeping the dark mode toggle in the top row. Circuit line preserved on all screen sizes (scales down on small phones instead of hiding).

**Mobile whitespace investigation:** The gap between navbar and content on mobile comes from bslib's `--bslib-spacer` CSS variable on `.bslib-sidebar-layout` grid. Overriding it to 0 removed the gap but also killed all internal card/component spacing. Left as-is for now — bslib's internal gap is not easily overridable without side effects. Tightened `padding-top` and `margin-bottom` where possible.

### Commits
- `add0c16` feat: dashboard polish - layout, charts, modals, and event type fixes
- `df93d05` feat: auto-assign UNKNOWN archetype for release events
- `d280d5f` style: improve mobile navbar layout and reduce whitespace

## 2026-02-18: v0.23 Polish, Performance & Pre-v0.22 Improvements

### Summary
Closed out v0.23 with 15 tasks across 6 phases: data sync, UI quick wins, dashboard improvements, performance optimizations, historical rating snapshots, and documentation. All work on the `develop` branch.

### Key Technical Decisions

**Connection pooling skipped:** Originally planned to use the `pool` R package for connection pooling. After analysis, determined DuckDB is embedded (in-process, not client-server), so pooling provides no benefit. Instead, enhanced `safe_query()` with auto-reconnection: detects invalid connection via `DBI::dbIsValid()`, calls `connect_db()` to get a fresh connection, updates `rv$db_con`, and retries the query.

**Dashboard query batching:** Consolidated ~18 individual dashboard queries into two batch reactives:
- `deck_analytics()` — single query for all deck data (entries, wins, meta share, colors)
- `core_metrics()` — tournament + player counts in one query
Downstream outputs read from these batch reactives instead of running their own queries.

**Community vs format sections:** Dashboard now splits into format-specific (top) and community (bottom) sections with a visual divider. Community queries (Rising Stars, Player Attendance, Player Growth, Recent Tournaments, Top Players) use scene-only filters via `build_community_filters()`, while format queries use full format+event+scene filters.

**Pill toggle component:** Created a reusable custom JS/CSS pill toggle instead of adding shinyWidgets dependency. Works via `Shiny.setInputValue()` on click, with server-side reset via `session$sendCustomMessage("resetPillToggle", ...)`.

**Historical rating snapshots:** Added `date_cutoff` parameter to `calculate_competitive_ratings()` for computing Elo as of a specific date. Snapshots are frozen at format-era boundaries (day before next format's release). Only BT24 had tournament data for its era in our dataset. Players tab automatically shows snapshot ratings when a historical format is selected.

### Commits (15 on develop)
- `e853aba` feat: load scene dropdown dynamically from database
- `8954505` feat: pill toggle filter for player minimum events (default 5+)
- `fa42eaf` feat: pill toggle for meta min entries, rename tab to Deck Meta
- `29a2149` feat: admin as lock icon only, move Ko-fi to header
- `933ea04` feat: collapse onboarding to single step (welcome + scene picker)
- `e14123a` feat: split dashboard into format-specific and community sections
- `b313bd4` fix: mobile header alignment and dark mode toggle visibility
- `3e0abc7` feat: make Top Decks and Rising Stars clickable (open modals)
- `850afd4` perf: add auto-reconnection to safe_query and clean shutdown handler
- `fcd9222` perf: batch dashboard queries (deck analytics + core metrics)
- `68aa007` schema: add rating_snapshots table for historical format ratings
- `6e79670` feat: add historical rating snapshots with backfill support
- `eb6aeb2` feat: show historical format ratings in player leaderboard

## 2026-02-17: Merge v0.21.1 Security Improvements into Multi-Region Branch

### Summary
Merged v0.21.1 Performance & Security Foundations (main) into feature/multi-region (develop) to combine SQL parameterization and safe_query() with scene filtering. This required resolving conflicts across 6 files and updating the query pattern to support both security improvements and scene filtering.

### Branch
`feature/multi-region` (develop)

### Merge Approach
The merge had conflicts in all public server files because:
- Main had: parameterized SQL queries with `?` placeholders + `safe_query()` wrapper
- Develop had: scene filtering with stores JOIN pattern

**Resolution:** Updated `build_filters_param()` to support both patterns:
```r
build_filters_param <- function(table_alias = "t",
                                 format = NULL,
                                 event_type = NULL,
                                 search = NULL,
                                 search_column = "display_name",
                                 id = NULL,
                                 id_column = "id",
                                 scene = NULL,         # NEW
                                 store_alias = NULL) { # NEW
  # ... existing filters ...

  # Scene filter (requires store_alias to be set)
  if (!is.null(scene) && scene != "" && scene != "all" && !is.null(store_alias)) {
    if (scene == "online") {
      sql_parts <- c(sql_parts, sprintf("AND %s.is_online = TRUE", store_alias))
    } else {
      sql_parts <- c(sql_parts, sprintf(
        "AND %s.scene_id = (SELECT scene_id FROM scenes WHERE slug = ?)",
        store_alias
      ))
      params <- c(params, list(scene))
    }
  }
  # ...
}
```

### Files Modified
- `server/shared-server.R` - Updated `build_filters_param()` with scene support
- `server/public-dashboard-server.R` - Updated `build_dashboard_filters()` with scene support, all 18 queries updated
- `server/public-players-server.R` - 2 queries updated with scene filtering
- `server/public-meta-server.R` - 4 queries updated with scene filtering
- `server/public-tournaments-server.R` - 1 query updated with scene filtering
- `server/public-stores-server.R` - 3 queries updated with scene filtering

### Pattern Now Used Across All Public Queries
1. **Parameterized SQL** - All user inputs use `?` placeholders
2. **safe_query() wrapper** - Graceful error handling with tryCatch
3. **Scene filtering** - Stores JOIN with scene_id filter
4. **bindCache()** - Cross-session caching with format, event_type, and scene keys

### Key Insight
The `build_filters_param()` helper now serves as the central abstraction for query filtering, supporting:
- Format filtering
- Event type filtering
- Search (text) filtering
- ID filtering
- **Scene filtering** (new, requires store_alias parameter)

This completes MR13 (Query builder abstraction) from the v0.23 roadmap.

## 2026-02-09: Multi-Region Scene Selection (v0.23 WIP)

### Summary
Implementing scene selection infrastructure to support filtering by local metro area. This is a simplified version of v0.23 - no Limitless API integration yet, just the scene filtering foundation.

### Branch
`feature/multi-region`

### Implementation

**New Files:**
- `views/onboarding-modal-ui.R` - Two-step first-visit modal (welcome + scene picker)
- `www/scene-selector.js` - localStorage persistence, geolocation support
- `server/scene-server.R` - Scene selection logic, onboarding handlers, `build_scene_filter()` helper

**Modified Files:**
- `app.R` - Added scene selector dropdown to header, sourced new files
- `www/custom.css` - Onboarding modal styling, header/footer adjustments
- All `server/public-*-server.R` files - Added scene filtering to queries

### Scene Filtering Pattern
All data queries now join with stores table and use the `build_scene_filter()` helper:
```r
build_scene_filter <- function(scene_slug, store_alias = "s") {
  if (is.null(scene_slug) || scene_slug == "" || scene_slug == "all") return("")
  if (scene_slug == "online") return(sprintf("AND %s.is_online = TRUE", store_alias))
  sprintf("AND %s.scene_id = (SELECT scene_id FROM scenes WHERE slug = '%s')", store_alias, scene_slug)
}
```

### Onboarding Flow
1. First visit: Check localStorage for `digilab_onboarding_complete`
2. If not complete, show welcome modal with feature cards
3. User clicks "Get Started" → scene picker with map
4. User can: click map marker, use geolocation, or choose Online/All Scenes
5. Selection saved to localStorage, modal closes, data refreshes

### UI Decisions
- Moved GitHub and Ko-fi links from header to footer (cleaner mobile)
- Admin button shows only lock icon on mobile (hide "Admin" text)
- Scene selector width: 140px desktop, 130px mobile

### Known Issues
- Mobile header alignment not working correctly (dark mode toggle visibility, right alignment)
- Will revisit after other priorities

---

## 2026-02-09: Deep Linking & Shareable URLs (v0.21.0)

### Summary
Implemented full deep linking system enabling shareable URLs for all entities. URLs update when modals open and browser back/forward navigation works correctly.

### URL Structure
- Players: `?player=atomshell` (uses slugified display_name)
- Decks: `?deck=blue-flare` (uses slug column)
- Stores: `?store=sci-fi-factory` (uses slug column)
- Tournaments: `?tournament=123` (uses ID, names not unique)
- Tabs: `?tab=meta`, `?tab=players`, `?tab=about`, etc.
- Scene: `?scene=dfw` (foundation for v0.23 multi-region)

### Technical Implementation

**Browser Side (`www/url-routing.js`):**
- `popstate` event listener for back/forward buttons
- Custom message handlers: `pushUrl`, `replaceUrl`, `historyBack`
- `hidden.bs.modal` listener to clear URL when modals close
- `copyCurrentUrl()` function for Copy Link button

**Server Side (`server/url-routing-server.R`):**
- `slugify()` helper for URL-friendly text conversion
- `parse_url_params()` / `build_url_query()` for URL handling
- `open_entity_from_url()` resolves slugs to entity IDs
- `update_url_for_*()` functions called when modals open
- Tab change observer updates URL (replace, not push)

### Schema Changes
- Added `scenes` table with hierarchy (Global → USA → Texas → DFW, plus Online)
- Added `slug` column to `stores` and `deck_archetypes`
- Added `scene_id` column to `stores` (all assigned to DFW scene)

### Key Decisions

**FK Constraints:**
- Removed FK constraints from local DuckDB (UPDATE = DELETE + INSERT causes violations)
- Kept FK constraints in MotherDuck for production data integrity
- Application-level integrity is sufficient for this use case

**Admin Pages:**
- Admin tabs clear URL to base (no shareable links)
- Prevents accidental sharing of admin state

**Cross-Modal Navigation:**
- Modal close detection uses 100ms delay
- Checks if another modal is visible before clearing URL
- Prevents URL flicker during modal-to-modal navigation

### Files Created/Modified
- `server/url-routing-server.R` (new) - 373 lines
- `www/url-routing.js` (new) - 144 lines
- `app.R` - Added script include and current_scene reactive
- `db/schema.sql` - scenes table, slug columns
- `server/public-*.R` - Added URL update calls and Copy Link buttons
- `scripts/sync_*.py` - Added scenes to table list

---

## 2026-02-09: Store Modal Polish & Map Improvements (v0.20.2)

### Summary
Completed stores tab improvements with modal redesign, rating system changes, and map enhancements.

### Store Modal Redesign

**Layout Changes:**
- Two-column layout: vertical stats list (left) + mini map (right)
- Address moved to modal header (street, city, state, zip format)
- Website link as icon in header (beside store name)
- Stats labels in bold for readability
- Mini map height matches stats box (218px)

**Rating Change:**
- Removed "Store Rating" (confusing 0-100 score that looked like quality judgment)
- Replaced with "Avg Player Rating" - weighted Elo average of players who compete there
- Weighting: players who attend more frequently count more toward the average
- Renamed "Avg Size" to "Avg Event Size" for clarity

### Map Improvements

**Bubble Sizing:**
- Changed from event count to tiered avg event size
- Tiers: 5px (no events), 10px (<8 players), 14px (8-12), 18px (13-18), 22px (19-24), 26px (25+)

**Removed Region Filter:**
- Removed lasso/draw filter functionality (~260 lines of code)
- Will be replaced by scene selection dropdown in v0.23

### Other Changes
- Enabled text selection in modals (CSS `user-select: text`)
- Synced store_schedules schema to MotherDuck

### Files Changed
- `R/ratings.R` - New `calculate_store_avg_player_rating()` function
- `app.R` - Renamed reactive from `store_ratings` to `store_avg_ratings`
- `server/public-stores-server.R` - Modal redesign, bubble sizing, removed region filter
- `server/public-dashboard-server.R` - Removed store_rating from recent tournaments
- `server/public-tournaments-server.R` - Removed store_rating from tournament modal
- `views/stores-ui.R` - Removed filter buttons and banner
- `www/custom.css` - Text selection, minor modal styling
- `CHANGELOG.md` - v0.20.2 release notes

---

## 2026-02-09: Store Schedules & Modal Improvements

### Summary
Implemented comprehensive Stores tab improvements: recurring schedule management, weekly calendar view, and enhanced store modal with mini map.

### Store Schedules Feature

**New Schema:** `store_schedules` table
- Tracks recurring event times (day_of_week, start_time, frequency)
- One row per day/time slot (stores with multiple events have multiple rows)
- Frequency options: weekly, biweekly, monthly
- Kept existing `schedule_info` as general notes field

**Admin UI:** Schedule management in Edit Stores
- Add/delete schedules when editing a physical store
- Shows day, time, frequency in a table
- Click to delete with confirmation

**Public View:** Schedule/All Stores toggle
- Schedule view: Weekly calendar sorted from current day ("Today" first)
- Shows stores with events each day + time
- "Stores without regular schedules" section at bottom
- All Stores view: Original store list with sorting

### Store Modal Improvements

**Layout Reorganization:**
- Stats box moved to top (right below store name)
- Two-column layout: store info (left) + mini map (right)
- Regular Schedule section shows store's recurring events

**Mini Map:**
- Interactive `atom_mapgl` with digital theme
- Orange circle marker at store location
- Hidden map controls for cleaner look
- Falls back gracefully if no coordinates

**Removed:** "Most Popular Deck" section (low value)

### Technical Notes

- Used `mapboxglOutput` inside modal by storing coords in `rv$modal_store_coords`
- `renderMapboxgl` reacts to coordinate changes and renders the map
- CSS hides map controls in mini map context

### Files Changed
- `db/schema.sql` - Added store_schedules table
- `scripts/migrate_add_store_schedules.R` - Migration script
- `scripts/sync_to_motherduck.py` - Added store_schedules to sync
- `scripts/sync_from_motherduck.py` - Added store_schedules to sync
- `server/admin-stores-server.R` - Schedule CRUD handlers
- `views/admin-stores-ui.R` - Schedule management UI
- `server/public-stores-server.R` - Schedule view + modal mini map
- `views/stores-ui.R` - View toggle UI
- `www/custom.css` - Schedule view + mini map styling
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` - New reactive values
- `docs/plans/2026-02-08-stores-tab-improvements.md` - Updated to complete

## 2026-02-08: Mapbox Geocoding & Stores Tab Planning

### Summary
Switched from OSM/Nominatim geocoding to Mapbox Geocoding API for more accurate store coordinates. Created comprehensive design document for future Stores tab improvements.

### Geocoding Change

**Problem:** OSM/Nominatim via tidygeocoder was producing inaccurate coordinates for some store addresses.

**Solution:** Replaced with Mapbox Geocoding API (already have token for map display).

**Implementation:**
- Added `geocode_with_mapbox()` helper function to `server/admin-stores-server.R`
- Uses httr2 for API calls (already a project dependency)
- Returns `list(lat, lng)` or `NA` values on failure
- Both add and update store handlers now use Mapbox

**Migration Script:** `scripts/migrate_geocode_stores.R`
- Re-geocodes all existing physical stores
- Dry run mode by default to preview changes
- Shows distance change from old to new coordinates
- Rate limited to avoid API throttling

### Future Stores Tab Improvements

Created design doc: `docs/plans/2026-02-08-stores-tab-improvements.md`

Planned features:
1. **Store Schedules Schema** - Structured table for recurring tournament schedules (day, time, event type, frequency)
2. **Upcoming Tournaments Display** - Table showing expected events this week based on schedules
3. **Store Modal Improvements** - Add mini map, show regular schedule, remove "most played deck"
4. **Store Rating Adjustments** - Potential changes to the 50/30/20 weighting
5. **Map Bubble Sizing** - Consider alternatives to current linear scaling

### Files Changed
- `server/admin-stores-server.R` - Mapbox geocoding helper + replaced tidygeocoder calls
- `scripts/migrate_geocode_stores.R` - New migration script
- `docs/plans/2026-02-08-stores-tab-improvements.md` - New design document

## 2026-02-07: Scene Health Dashboard Section

### Summary
Added a new "Scene Health" section to the dashboard providing competition health metrics at a glance. Includes a Highcharts gauge, player growth chart, and Rising Stars feature.

### Components Added

**Meta Diversity Gauge**
- Highcharts solidgauge showing diversity score (0-100)
- Based on Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI) of win distribution across decks
- Color stops: red (0-40), yellow (40-70), green (70-100)
- Shows "X decks with wins" as subtitle

**Player Growth & Retention Chart**
- Stacked bar chart by month
- Three categories: New (first tournament), Returning (<3 events), Regulars (3+ events)
- Uses strftime instead of DATE_TRUNC for Windows DuckDB compatibility

**Rising Stars** (separate card)
- Shows top 4 players with most top-3 finishes in last 30 days
- Own card section below Scene Health for cleaner layout
- Card layout with rank badge, name, trophy/medal counts, and current rating
- Limited to 4 for consistent display across screen sizes

### Removed Components

**Event Health Indicator** - Removed as redundant with existing "Tournament Player Counts Over Time" chart

### Technical Notes

**Windows DuckDB Compatibility**
- `DATE_TRUNC` and `INTERVAL` require ICU extension (not available on Windows mingw builds)
- Replaced with `strftime('%Y-%m', date)` for month truncation
- Date arithmetic done in R and passed as formatted strings

**Highcharts solidgauge**
- Uses `hc_pane()` for semi-circular arc configuration
- Color stops defined via `hc_yAxis(stops = ...)` for gradient effect
- Data labels positioned with `y = -25` to center in gauge

### Design Doc
Full design documented in `docs/plans/2026-02-07-scene-health-dashboard-design.md`

## 2026-02-06: Mobile Navigation & Pre-Merge Polish

### Summary
Added mobile bottom tab bar, polished submission flow, and updated content pages before merging `feature/public-submissions` to main.

### Mobile Bottom Tab Bar
Replaced the bslib sidebar on mobile with a fixed bottom tab bar (Instagram/Twitter style):
- 6 tabs: Overview, Players, Meta, Tournaments, Stores, Upload
- Sidebar and toggle arrow hidden via `display: none !important` at ≤768px
- `bslib-sidebar-layout` `--_sidebar-width` set to 0px on mobile
- Active state syncs via extended `updateSidebarNav` JS handler with `navToTab` mapping
- Initially tried a floating action button (FAB) for Upload, but user preferred it as a 6th tab

### Admin Modal for Mobile
Since sidebar is hidden on mobile, admin tabs needed an alternative access point:
- When logged in, the Admin header button opens a modal with styled card-link navigation
- Links use `removeModal()` before navigating to avoid stacking
- Styled with background cards, orange hover accents, `translateX(2px)` shift — mobile only via media query
- Desktop modal remains unchanged (status + logout only)

### Content Page Updates
- **For Organizers**: Rewrote to reflect self-service OCR upload (was referencing manual submission)
- **FAQ**: Updated data source to mention OCR upload, "Achv" → "Score", update frequency to "immediately"
- **About**: Updated player/TO descriptions for self-service flow
- Added cross-page `actionLink` navigation (FAQ → Upload, For Organizers → Upload)

### Submission Polish
- Added confirmation checkbox before final submit (`input$submit_confirm` validation)
- Moved match indicator next to placement badge on mobile (absolute positioning on desktop to avoid regression)
- Comprehensive mobile responsive CSS for Upload Results page

### Mobile Whitespace Issue (Deferred)
Investigated gap between header and content on mobile. Root cause: bslib's `page_fillable()` applies `padding: 1rem` to the body. Header uses `margin: -1rem` to counteract, but sidebar layout only offsets left/right. CSS overrides on `body.bslib-page-fill` didn't take effect — likely bslib's inline styles or JS-applied styles winning specificity. Will revisit — may need `page_fillable(padding=0)` or custom JS.

### Mobile Value Box Grid (Deferred)
Attempted 2x2 grid for stat cards on mobile. bslib uses `<bslib-layout-columns>` custom element with `col-widths-sm` attributes. CSS `grid-template-columns` override didn't work — the custom element likely applies grid via JS/shadow DOM. Will need to either use `page_fillable` args or wrap in custom div. Card images set to ghost watermark style (25% opacity, positioned right) for when grid is fixed.

## 2026-02-06: Admin / Super Admin Tiers & renv Sync

### Summary
Added a barebones two-tier admin system using passwords, and synced renv for the first time after many package additions.

### Admin Tiers
Implemented a simple admin vs superadmin split to reduce sidebar clutter for regular tournament organizers:
- **Admin** (`ADMIN_PASSWORD`): Enter Results, Edit Tournaments, Edit Players, Edit Decks
- **Super Admin** (`SUPERADMIN_PASSWORD`): Edit Stores, Edit Formats (plus all admin tabs)

Uses the same single-password-field login modal — the entered password determines the role. Superadmin password is checked first (so if both are the same, you get superadmin). Server-side `req(rv$is_superadmin)` guards protect stores/formats even from programmatic access.

This is a stopgap before Discord OAuth in v0.22. Keeps things simple while letting us onboard scene admins who only need result entry access.

### renv Sync
First full `renv::restore()` on the project. Key issues:
- `duckdb` wouldn't compile from source on Windows (rtools header issue) — installed binary (1.4.4) instead
- `atomtemplates` (private GitHub package) needed `GITHUB_PAT` from `gh auth token`
- `dotenv` and `httr2` were used in code but missing from lockfile — added via `renv::snapshot()`
- R updated from 4.5.0 to 4.5.1

### Sidebar Width
Bumped from 220px to 230px — "Edit Tournaments" was wrapping to two lines on some viewports.

---

## 2026-02-06: Deck Request Queue & Database Sync

### Summary
Added deck request queue for public submissions and synced schema changes to MotherDuck. Users can now request new deck archetypes during submission, which go to admin review.

### Deck Request Queue Design
Implemented "Option B" from brainstorming - adding a dropdown option rather than a separate link:
- "➕ Request new deck..." option at top of deck dropdown
- Opens modal for deck name, primary/secondary color, optional card ID
- Pending requests appear in all dropdowns as "Pending: [deck name]"
- Admin sees pending requests section at top of Edit Decks tab

### Admin Review Workflow
- **Approve**: Creates archetype with original values, auto-links results
- **Edit & Approve**: Opens modal to modify before creating
- **Reject**: Marks rejected, sets results to UNKNOWN archetype

### Technical Challenges

**Dynamic Button Handlers**: Initial implementation used `observeEvent` inside `observe()` with `once=TRUE`, but this doesn't work for dynamically rendered buttons. Fixed by using `onclick` handlers with `Shiny.setInputValue()`:
```r
# Instead of dynamic observeEvent (unreliable)
tags$button(
  onclick = sprintf("Shiny.setInputValue('deck_request_approve_click', %d, {priority: 'event'})", req_id),
  "Approve"
)
```

**DuckDB Auto-Increment**: Unlike SQLite, DuckDB INTEGER PRIMARY KEY doesn't auto-increment. Must manually generate IDs:
```r
max_id <- dbGetQuery(con, "SELECT COALESCE(MAX(request_id), 0) FROM deck_requests")$max_id
new_id <- max_id + 1
```

**MotherDuck Sync Schema Mismatch**: `sync_from_motherduck.py` failed when local schema had more columns than cloud (e.g., `member_number`). Fixed by explicitly selecting only cloud columns:
```python
cloud_cols = get_table_columns(conn, MOTHERDUCK_DB, table)
cols_str = ", ".join(cloud_cols)
conn.execute(f"INSERT INTO local_db.{table} ({cols_str}) SELECT {cols_str} FROM cloud.{table}")
```

### Database Schema Changes
- `deck_requests` table for pending submissions
- `pending_deck_request_id` column in results for auto-linking
- Migration script: `scripts/migrate_v0.20.0.R`

### UX Improvements
- Duplicate tournament warning when store/date already exists
- Input width fix for modal dropdowns (CSS min-width: 0)

---

## 2026-02-05: Public Submissions v0.20 - OCR Upload & Player Matching

### Summary
Implemented full public submission flow with OCR processing, player pre-matching, and editable results preview. This allows users to upload tournament screenshots and have the data extracted and matched against existing database records.

### OCR Parser Improvements
Fixed issues discovered during testing:
- **Combined format handling**: Fixed parsing of "10 Sinone" format where OCR puts placement on same line as username
- **Match history round detection**: Skip numbers that appear after header text, increased search window from 10 to 15 lines
- **WebP support**: Added `.webp` image format support to file uploads

### Match History Tab Implementation
Fully implemented the Match History submission flow (was previously just a placeholder):
- Tournament selector filtered by store
- Player info inputs (username, member number)
- Screenshot upload with OCR processing
- Results preview with round-by-round data
- Submit to database

### Database Schema
Added `matches` table for storing round-by-round match data:
```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS matches (
    match_id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    tournament_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    round_number INTEGER NOT NULL,
    player_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    opponent_id INTEGER NOT NULL,
    games_won INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    games_lost INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    games_tied INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    match_points INTEGER NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    submitted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    UNIQUE(tournament_id, round_number, player_id)
);
```

### Naming Clarification
Renamed "Submit" to "Upload Results" throughout the app to differentiate from admin manual entry:
- **Upload Results** (public): Screenshot-based OCR entry
- **Enter Results** (admin): Manual one-by-one entry

### Player Pre-Matching
After OCR parsing, players are now automatically matched against the database:
- **Primary match**: By member_number (exact match = "matched" status)
- **Fallback match**: By username (exact match = "possible" status)
- **No match**: Marked as "new" player to be created

### Editable Results Preview
Users can now correct OCR errors before submission:
- Member number field is editable
- Points field is editable (recalculates W-L-T)
- Reject match button to undo auto-matching
- Visual status badges (Matched/Possible/New)

### Processing UX
Added spinner modal during OCR processing:
- Shows "Processing Screenshots" with Bootstrap spinner
- Modal blocks interaction until complete
- Provides clear feedback that work is happening

### W-L-T Auto-Calculation
Points are converted to W-L-T using tournament round count:
- `wins = points ÷ 3`
- `ties = points % 3`
- `losses = rounds - wins - ties`

### Files Changed

## 2026-02-04: Content Pages Implementation & UI Polish

### Summary
Implemented content pages feature (About, FAQ, For Organizers) with footer navigation, plus significant UI improvements to create a seamless app frame.

### Content Pages (feature/content-pages branch)
Created three new content pages accessible via footer navigation:

**About Page** (`views/about-ui.R`)
- Live stats from database (stores, players, tournaments, results)
- "Track. Compete. Connect." tagline
- Current coverage section highlighting North Texas
- Built By section with centered GitHub/Ko-fi/Contact links

**FAQ Page** (`views/faq-ui.R`)
- Accordion-based collapsible sections
- Enhanced rating explanations (Competitive Rating with implied results, Achievement Score with tournament bonuses, Store Rating meaning)
- Bug report section with GitHub and Google Form links

**For Organizers Page** (`views/for-tos-ui.R`)
- Renamed from "For TOs" (user didn't like acronym)
- Step-by-step guides for submitting results
- New sections: submitting match history, becoming a contributor
- Info notes about deck info being optional initially
- Google Form placeholder links throughout

### Footer Navigation
- Styled bar matching header aesthetic (blue gradient, grid pattern)
- Positioned outside `layout_sidebar` to span full viewport width
- Links: About // FAQ // For Organizers
- Version number and copyright

### Seamless App Frame (Sidebar Styling)
Major CSS work to create cohesive "frame" around content:
- **Sidebar gradient**: Changed to vertical (180deg) so bottom color matches footer's left edge
- **Edge alignment**: `margin-left: calc(-1rem - 1px)` to extend sidebar to left edge
- **Right edge**: Extended main content to right edge with `margin-right: -1rem`
- **Gap removal**: Eliminated gaps between header/sidebar/footer
- **Mobile fixes**: Adjusted margins for mobile view

### Dashboard Improvements
- **Hot Deck value box**: Added card image showcase (matching Top Deck style)
- **Top Deck value box**: Added trophy icon to label
- **Content spacing**: Added margin between cards and grids for better visual separation

### CSS Changes
- Added `contact-links--centered` modifier class
- Added `.info-note` styling for tip callouts
- Added dashboard content spacing rules
- Light/dark mode support for all new elements

### Files Changed
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Footer, APP_VERSION, nav panels |
| `views/about-ui.R` | New file |
| `views/faq-ui.R` | New file |
| `views/for-tos-ui.R` | New file |
| `server/shared-server.R` | Navigation handlers, About stats |
| `server/public-dashboard-server.R` | hot_deck_image output |
| `views/dashboard-ui.R` | Hot Deck image, Top Deck icon |
| `www/custom.css` | ~600 lines added for footer, content pages, sidebar frame |

## 2026-02-04: Design Session - Region Expansion, Deep Linking, Content Pages

### Summary
Design session to plan three interconnected features for v0.19-v0.21. Created comprehensive design docs for each.

### OCR Parser Fixes (feature/public-submissions branch)
- Added `.webp` image support to batch test script
- Fixed match history parser to handle variable OCR ordering (W-L-T sometimes appears after member number)
- Batch testing now processes 6 screenshots successfully

### Region Expansion Design
Designed a nested geographic hierarchy for multi-region support:
- **Structure**: Global → Country → State → Scene → Store
- **Key decision**: Players don't belong to Scenes (no accounts), only Stores do
- **Leaderboards**: Filtered views of global rating based on where players have competed
- **Tournament tiers**: Local (Scene), Regional (State), National (Country)

### Deep Linking Design
Designed shareable URL system:
- **Format**: `?player=atomshell`, `?deck=blue-flare`, `?scene=dfw`
- **Slug resolution**: Exact match opens modal, multiple matches show search results
- **Browser history**: Back button closes modals (pushState/popstate)
- **Copy Link button**: In each modal for easy sharing

### Content Pages Design
Designed in-app content pages accessed via styled footer:
- **About**: What is DigiLab, coverage, team
- **FAQ**: Accordion sections for methodology, how-to, ratings
- **For TOs**: Submit results, add stores, request regions
- **Footer**: Styled bar matching header aesthetic (dark bg, circuit accents, cyan glow)

### Google Analytics
Discussed GA4 enhancement approach:
- Current basic tracking is sufficient for Phase 1
- User to explore existing GA4 reports first (geo, retention, engagement)
- Custom events (tab views, modal opens) only after identifying gaps

### Design Documents Created
| Document | Path |
|----------|------|
| Region Expansion | `docs/plans/2026-02-04-region-expansion-design.md` |
| Deep Linking | `docs/plans/2026-02-04-deep-linking-design.md` |
| Content Pages | `docs/plans/2026-02-04-content-pages-design.md` |

## 2026-02-04: v0.19 Public Submissions - Phase 1 Implementation

### Summary

Implemented Phase 1 of the public submissions feature: core OCR integration and Submit Results UI. The feature allows anyone to upload tournament screenshots from the Bandai TCG+ app and have them automatically parsed into structured data.

### Completed Tasks

| Task | Description | Files Created/Modified |
|------|-------------|----------------------|
| 1 | Add member_number to players table | `db/schema.sql`, `scripts/migrate_add_member_number.R` |
| 2 | Create OCR module | `R/ocr.R` |
| 3 | Create Submit Results UI | `views/submit-ui.R`, `app.R` |
| 4 | Create Submit Results server logic | `server/public-submit-server.R` |
| 5 | Test and debug OCR parsing | Multiple iterations on `R/ocr.R` |
| 6 | Add match history parser | `R/ocr.R` - `parse_match_history()` |
| 7 | Add defensive OCR filters | `R/ocr.R` - status bar, store names, event metadata |
| 8 | Improve multi-screenshot deduplication | `server/public-submit-server.R` |
| 9 | Create CLI test harness | `scripts/test_ocr.R` |
| 10 | Create batch testing script | `scripts/batch_test_ocr.R` |

### OCR Implementation Details

**API Choice:** Google Cloud Vision API via direct httr2 REST calls
- Feature: `DOCUMENT_TEXT_DETECTION` (optimized for structured documents)
- Free tier: 1,000 images/month
- Handles both file paths and raw bytes

**Parsing Strategy (Tournament Standings):**
1. Find potential usernames (alphabetic text, not headers)
2. Scan forward to find associated member number
3. Extract placement and points from numbers between username and member number
4. Calculate W-L-T from points (3 per win, 1 per tie)

**Parsing Strategy (Match History):**
1. Find potential opponent usernames
2. Scan forward for: round number, results (X-X-X), points, member number
3. Sort by round number

**Defensive Filters Added:**
- `is_status_bar_noise()` - Filters time (12:17), battery %, signal (LTE, 5G)
- `is_store_name()` - Filters business names (Games, Cards, Hobby, etc.)
- `is_event_metadata()` - Filters bracketed dates, event type keywords
- Forward-scan approach naturally excludes status bar content (position-based safety)

**Challenges Encountered:**
- OCR returns each table cell as separate lines, not row-by-row
- Battery percentage (50%) was being captured as data - added filter
- "Member Number XXXXXXXXXX" was being detected as username - added exclusion
- Placement numbers sometimes missing for first player - use sequential fallback
- Large tournaments (64-128 players) - removed value-based filtering, use position-based instead
- Noise lines between username and data - increased forward scan range (8→12 lines)

**Known Limitations:**
- Parsing is tuned to Bandai TCG+ app screenshot format
- Different phone models/screen sizes may produce different OCR layouts
- Users can manually edit parsed results before submitting

### Testing Infrastructure

**CLI Test Harness (`scripts/test_ocr.R`):**
- `test_image(path)` - Full OCR flow for standings
- `test_match_history(path)` - Full OCR flow for match history
- `retest()` - Re-parse saved OCR text without API call
- Saves OCR text to file for iterative parser development

**Batch Testing (`scripts/batch_test_ocr.R`):**
- Process all screenshots in `screenshots/standings/` and `screenshots/match_history/`
- Generate `summary.csv` with results and warnings
- Flag problematic screenshots automatically
- `batch_retest()` - Re-parse all saved OCR text without API calls
- `review_flagged()` - Interactive review of problem files

### Multi-Screenshot Deduplication

Improved from naive `!duplicated(placement)` to smart deduplication:
1. Primary key: `member_number` (unique per player)
2. Fallback: `username` (case-insensitive)
3. Re-sequence placements after dedup to handle gaps

### Schema Changes

Added `member_number` column to players table:
```sql
member_number VARCHAR,  -- Bandai TCG+ member number (0000XXXXXX)
```

Note: DuckDB doesn't support `ALTER TABLE ADD COLUMN ... UNIQUE`, so uniqueness is enforced at application level only.

### Branch Status

**Branch:** `feature/public-submissions`
**Commits:** 12 commits ahead of origin
**Status:** Phase 1 complete, awaiting test screenshots from testing team

### Next Steps (Phase 2+)

1. Create store_requests and deck_requests tables
2. Build admin approval queue UI
3. ~~Add match history OCR parsing~~ ✓ Complete
4. Mobile optimization
5. More robust error handling for varied screenshot formats

---

## 2026-02-03: v0.19 Public Submissions Design

### Summary

Completed comprehensive design for community-driven data entry via screenshot uploads with OCR. This is a major feature that enables anyone to contribute tournament data, reducing admin bottleneck and supporting multi-region expansion.

### Key Design Decisions

**Trust Model:**
- Screenshots = high trust (evidence-based, goes live immediately)
- Manual entry = admin/verified users only
- New store/deck requests = approval queue

**Submission Types:**
1. Tournament standings screenshot → OCR extracts placements, usernames, points
2. Match history screenshot → Round-by-round opponent data
3. Deck assignment → Anyone can fix UNKNOWN decks

**OCR Technology:**
- Chose direct httr2 calls to Google Cloud Vision API
- Rejected `tesseract` R package (requires system libs not on Posit Connect Cloud)
- Rejected `googleCloudVisionR` package (last updated 2020, unmaintained)
- Free tier: 1,000 images/month

**No User Accounts:**
- Screenshots are self-documenting evidence
- Player matching via Bandai member number (OCR'd from screenshots)
- Decks editable by anyone (click-to-edit, click-to-confirm pattern)

### Schema Changes Planned

1. Add `member_number` to `players` table (nullable, unique)
2. New `matches` table for round-by-round data
3. New `store_requests` and `deck_requests` tables for approval queue

### Branching Strategy

Per v1.0 release strategy, all v0.19+ features developed on feature branches:
- Branch: `feature/public-submissions`
- Will merge to main only at v1.0 release

### Google Cloud Vision API Setup

See "Google Cloud Vision API Setup" section below for credentials setup instructions.

### Files Created

- `docs/plans/2026-02-03-public-submissions-design.md` - Full design document
- Updated `ROADMAP.md` with new v0.19-v0.22 structure

---

## Google Cloud Vision API Setup

Instructions for setting up OCR integration.

### Step 1: Create Google Cloud Project

1. Go to [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/)
2. Click "Select a project" → "New Project"
3. Name it (e.g., "digilab-ocr") and create

### Step 2: Enable Billing

1. Go to [Billing](https://console.cloud.google.com/billing)
2. Link a billing account to your project
3. Note: Free tier includes 1,000 images/month

### Step 3: Enable Vision API

1. Go to [API Library](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/library)
2. Search for "Cloud Vision API"
3. Click "Enable"

### Step 4: Create API Key

1. Go to [Credentials](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials)
2. Click "+ CREATE CREDENTIALS" → "API key"
3. Copy the key (you won't see it again)
4. Optional: Restrict key to Cloud Vision API only (recommended)

### Step 5: Configure in App

Add to `.env` file:
```
GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Add to Posit Connect Cloud environment variables in deployment settings.

### Usage in R

```r
library(httr2)

gcv_ocr <- function(image_path) {
  api_key <- Sys.getenv("GOOGLE_CLOUD_VISION_API_KEY")
  image_data <- base64enc::base64encode(image_path)

  response <- request("https://vision.googleapis.com/v1/images:annotate") |>
    req_url_query(key = api_key) |>
    req_body_json(list(
      requests = list(list(
        image = list(content = image_data),
        features = list(list(type = "TEXT_DETECTION"))
      ))
    )) |>
    req_perform() |>
    resp_body_json()

  response$responses[[1]]$fullTextAnnotation$text
}
```

### Cost Reference

| Usage | Cost |
|-------|------|
| First 1,000 units/month | Free |
| 1,001 - 5,000,000 units | $1.50 per 1,000 |

For a regional tournament tracker, free tier is likely sufficient.

## 2026-02-03: v0.18.1 - Code Cleanup Refactor (R4 + R5)

### Summary
Completed two cleanup tasks from the server extraction refactor plan:
- **R4**: Reactive values cleanup - documented, grouped, and standardized naming
- **R5**: CSS cleanup - extracted inline styles to CSS classes

### R4: Reactive Values Cleanup

Created `ARCHITECTURE.md` as the technical reference for the codebase. Documents:
- Server module structure and naming conventions
- All 32 reactive values organized into 6 categories
- Navigation, modal, and database patterns
- Quick reference cheatsheet

Reactive values were reorganized in `app.R` with explicit initialization and clear section comments.

### R5: CSS Cleanup

**Problem**: 38 inline styles scattered across R files made styling inconsistent and hard to maintain.

**Solution**: Extracted 21 inline styles to named CSS classes. Kept 10+ inline styles that need to remain inline (display toggles for JS, dynamic colors in sprintf).

**New CSS Classes Added:**
- `.card-search-grid`, `.card-search-item`, `.card-search-thumbnail`, `.card-search-text-id` - Admin deck card search
- `.clickable-row` - Cursor pointer for clickable table rows
- `.help-icon` - Cursor help for info icons
- `.top-deck-image`, `.deck-modal-image` - Image sizing for deck displays
- `.result-action-btn` - Action buttons in results table
- `.map-container-flush` - Remove padding from map container
- `.store-filter-badge--success`, `.store-filter-badge--info` - Store filter badge variants

**Files Updated:**
- `server/admin-decks-server.R` - 9 styles extracted
- `views/admin-decks-ui.R` - 3 styles extracted
- `server/admin-results-server.R` - 2 styles extracted
- `server/public-dashboard-server.R` - 1 style extracted
- `server/public-meta-server.R` - 2 styles extracted
- `server/public-stores-server.R` - 2 styles extracted
- `server/public-tournaments-server.R` - 1 style extracted
- `views/stores-ui.R` - 1 style extracted

### Documentation Updates

Also added to `CLAUDE.md`:
- Required Workflows section (superpowers usage, git workflow, R path, code verification)
- Documentation Updates requirements

Moved `PROJECT_PLAN.md` to `docs/original-project-plan.md` as historical reference.

## 2026-02-03: v0.18.0 - Server Extraction Refactor

### Summary
Major codebase refactor to improve maintainability. Extracted all public page server logic from the monolithic `app.R` (3,178 lines) into modular `server/public-*.R` files. The main `app.R` is now a thin wrapper at 566 lines.

### Motivation
- **Maintainability**: The 3,000+ line monolith was becoming difficult to navigate
- **Onboarding**: Smaller, focused files are less intimidating for contributors
- **Bug Prevention**: Standardized patterns reduce copy-paste errors
- **Future-Proofing**: Cleaner base for multi-game expansion

### Design Process
Used brainstorming skill to design the refactor approach:
- Identified that public page logic was the largest portion of `app.R`
- Decided on incremental extraction (one tab at a time) to minimize risk
- Established naming convention: `public-*` for public tabs, `admin-*` for admin tabs
- Created design document: `docs/plans/2026-02-03-server-extraction-refactor.md`

### Implementation

**Extraction Order** (simplest to most complex):
1. Meta tab → `public-meta-server.R` (305 lines)
2. Stores tab → `public-stores-server.R` (851 lines)
3. Tournaments tab → `public-tournaments-server.R` (237 lines)
4. Players tab → `public-players-server.R` (364 lines)
5. Dashboard tab → `public-dashboard-server.R` (889 lines)

**Naming Standardization**:
- Renamed `results-server.R` → `admin-results-server.R`
- All admin modules now use `admin-*` prefix
- All public modules use `public-*` prefix

### Technical Notes

**What stayed in app.R**:
- Library imports
- Environment setup
- Helper functions (parse_schedule_info, deck_color_badge)
- UI definitions
- Reactive values initialization
- Rating calculations (shared across multiple tabs)
- Source calls to server modules

**Cross-tab handlers**:
- `modal_player_clicked` - Opens player modal from any context (kept in Stores for now)
- `overview_player_clicked` / `overview_tournament_clicked` - From Dashboard to detail tabs
- These handlers navigate between tabs and open modals

**Testing approach**:
- Extracted one file at a time
- Tested app launch after each extraction
- Committed after each successful extraction
- Used separate `refactor/server-extraction` branch

### Results

| Metric | Before | After |
|--------|--------|-------|
| `app.R` lines | 3,178 | 566 |
| Server modules | 7 | 12 |
| Reduction | - | 82% |

### Future Considerations (Out of Scope)
- Reactive value cleanup: Document, group, standardize naming (~30+ rv values)
- CSS cleanup: Consolidate custom.css, remove inline styles from R code

## 2026-02-03: v0.17.0 - Admin UX Improvements

### Summary
Released v0.17.0 addressing key admin pain points: editing tournament results is now accessible from Edit Tournaments page, date field requires explicit selection to prevent wrong dates, and duplicate tournament flow navigates to edit mode.

### Design Process
Used brainstorming skill to explore the problem space before implementation:
- **Pain point 1**: Editing player results required navigating through Enter Results wizard, finding the tournament, then editing - unintuitive for quick corrections
- **Pain point 2**: Date field defaulted to today, causing accidental wrong date submissions
- **Pain point 3**: After duplicating a tournament, staying on Enter Results page was confusing

Design document: `docs/plans/2026-02-03-admin-ux-improvements-design.md`

### Implementation

**Edit Results Modal (from Edit Tournaments)**
- Added "View/Edit Results" button that appears when a tournament is selected
- Modal shows tournament summary (store, date, format, player count) and results table
- Click any row to edit: player, deck, placement, W/L/T, decklist URL
- Add new results directly from modal
- Delete results with confirmation dialog
- Uses nested modals (results modal → edit modal → delete confirmation)

**Required Date Field**
- Changed `dateInput` default from `Sys.Date()` to `NA`
- Added CSS class `date-required` with red border styling
- Added "Required" hint text below field
- Observer shows/hides validation styling based on date selection
- Create tournament handler validates date before submission

**Duplicate Tournament Flow**
- After duplication, now calls `nav_select()` to switch to Edit Tournaments tab
- Sets `rv$navigate_to_tournament_id` to auto-select the new tournament
- Observer in Edit Tournaments picks up the ID and populates the form

### Bug Fixes During Testing

**Date Observer Error**
- Issue: `is.na()` failed on zero-length date input during initial load
- Fix: Check `length(input$tournament_date) > 0` before `anyNA()`

**Reactable Column Name Error**
- Issue: R data.frame converts `` `#` `` to invalid column name
- Fix: Use `Place` internally, `colDef(name = "#")` for display

**Modal Input Widths**
- Issue: Place/Wins/Losses/Ties fields not evenly distributed
- Fix: Wrapped in `layout_columns(col_widths = c(3, 3, 3, 3))` with CSS override for min-width

**Decklist URL Display**
- Issue: Field showed unexpected content for some records
- Fix: Robust null checking for NULL, NA, "", "NA" literal, zero-length values

### Technical Notes

**Shiny Date Input Edge Cases**
When using `dateInput` with `value = NA`, the input starts as zero-length vector, not NA. Must check:
```r
date_valid <- !is.null(input$date) &&
              length(input$date) > 0 &&
              !anyNA(input$date)
```

**Cross-Tab Navigation with Auto-Selection**
Pattern for navigating to a tab and auto-selecting a record:
1. Set reactive value: `rv$navigate_to_tournament_id <- new_id`
2. Navigate: `nav_select("main_nav", "admin_tournaments")`
3. Observer in target tab watches for the reactive value, populates form, clears value

**Nested Bootstrap Modals**
Bootstrap 5 supports nested modals but requires `data-bs-backdrop="static"` on parent to prevent dismissal when clicking backdrop. Child modals appear above parent.

### Files Changed
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `views/admin-tournaments-ui.R` | Added View/Edit Results button, results modal, edit modal, delete confirmation modal |
| `server/admin-tournaments-server.R` | Added modal handlers, edit/delete/add result handlers, navigate observer |
| `views/admin-results-ui.R` | Changed date default to NA, added required styling |
| `server/results-server.R` | Added date validation, updated duplicate flow navigation |
| `app.R` | Initialized new reactive values (modal_results_refresh, modal_tournament_id, navigate_to_tournament_id) |
| `www/custom.css` | Added date-required styles, modal-numeric-inputs fix |

## 2026-02-02: Bug Fix, Branding & Analytics

### Summary
Fixed a SQL bug in player search, created initial branding assets (logo, icon, favicon), and set up Google Analytics for DigiLab.

### Bug Fix: Player Search Query
- **Issue**: Searching for players by name in the Players tab caused SQL error: "Referenced table p not found"
- **Root cause**: The `main_decks` subquery used `search_filter` which referenced `p.display_name`, but the subquery didn't join the `players` table
- **Fix**: Added `JOIN players p ON r.player_id = p.player_id` to the `main_decks` CTE in `app.R:2311`

### Branding Assets
Created SVG assets for DigiLab branding:
- `docs/digilab-logo.svg` - Banner format (400x200) with "DigiLab" text, subtitle, grid pattern, cyan circuit accents
- `docs/digilab-icon.svg` - Square format (200x200) with "DL" initials
- `docs/favicon.svg` - Minimal favicon (32x32) with "D" letter, orange accent dot

Design notes:
- Attempted to create a digivice-shaped logo based on original Digimon Adventure digivice, but the complex shape was difficult to replicate accurately in SVG
- Simplified to text-based logo with the app's existing digital aesthetic (grid pattern, cyan glow, circuit accents)
- May revisit digivice logo in future with traced reference or professional design

### Google Analytics
Added GA4 tracking (measurement ID: G-NJ3SMG8HGG) to monitor site usage:
- Added to `docs/index.html` for GitHub Pages wrapper tracking
- Added to `app.R` for Shiny app tracking
- Both send data to the same GA property
- Basic page-level tracking; custom event tracking (tab clicks, etc.) can be added later if needed

### Files Changed
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Added missing players table join in main_decks query; added GA4 tracking script |
| `docs/index.html` | Added favicon link, updated OG/Twitter images, added GA4 tracking script |
| `docs/digilab-logo.svg` | New file - banner logo |
| `docs/digilab-icon.svg` | New file - square icon |
| `docs/favicon.svg` | New file - browser tab favicon |

## 2026-02-02: v0.15.0 - Bug Fixes & Quick Polish

### Summary
Released v0.15.0 with bug fixes, UI improvements, and new table columns. Also created ROADMAP.md to track all planned work through v1.0.

### Key Changes

**Modal Selection Bug Fix (B1)**
- Root cause: Tables used row index to look up record ID, but re-ran query with hardcoded ORDER BY. After user sorting, visual order didn't match query order.
- Fix: Changed from `onClick="select"` + `getReactableState()` to JavaScript `onClick` callbacks that pass actual row data via `Shiny.setInputValue()`.
- Affected tables: archetype_stats, player_standings, store_list, tournament_history
- Documented in `docs/solutions/modal-selection-bug.md`

**Table Column Reorganization**
- Players Tab: Added Record (W-L-T with colored numbers), Main Deck (with color badge)
- Meta Tab: Added Meta % (share of entries), Conv % (Top 3s / Entries), removed Avg Place
- Used pre-computed HTML columns to avoid reactable pagination index issues

**Other Changes**
- Blue deck badge: "B" → "U" (black stays "B")
- Default 32 rows for main tables
- GitHub + Ko-fi links in header
- Top decks reduced from 8 to 6 for cleaner responsive grids
- UNKNOWN archetype filtered from all analytics (but visible in historical records)

### Technical Notes

**Pre-computed HTML columns in reactable**
When using `cell = function(value, index)`, the `index` refers to the current page position, not the full dataframe index. For columns that need to reference other columns (like Record needing W, L, T values), pre-compute the HTML before passing to reactable:
```r
result$Record <- sapply(1:nrow(result), function(i) {
  sprintf("<span style='color: green;'>%d</span>-<span style='color: red;'>%d</span>",
    result$W[i], result$L[i])
})
# Then use html = TRUE in colDef
```

### Files Changed
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Modal fixes, column reorganization, Ko-fi link, top decks limit |
| `www/custom.css` | Ko-fi hover color (coral) |
| `ROADMAP.md` | New file - full roadmap v0.15 through v1.0 |
| `docs/solutions/modal-selection-bug.md` | New file - bug documentation |

## 2026-02-01: Rating System Implementation

### Summary
Implemented comprehensive rating system with three distinct scores:
1. **Competitive Rating** - Elo-style skill rating (1200-2000+)
2. **Achievement Score** - Points-based engagement metric
3. **Store Rating** - Venue quality score (0-100)

### Design Documents
- Full methodology: `docs/plans/2026-02-01-rating-system-design.md`
- Implementation plan: `docs/plans/2026-02-01-rating-system-implementation.md`

### Key Technical Decisions

**Elo-Style Competitive Rating**
- Uses "implied results" from placements (place 3rd = beat everyone 4th+, lost to 1st-2nd)
- 5 iterative passes for rating convergence (strength of schedule)
- 4-month half-life decay keeps ratings current
- Round multiplier: 1.0x (3 rounds) to 1.4x (7+ rounds)
- K-factor: 48 for provisional (< 5 events), 24 for established

**Achievement Score**
- Base points: 1st=50, 2nd=30, 3rd=20, Top4=15, Top8=10, Participated=5
- Size multiplier: 1.0x (8-11) to 2.0x (32+ players)
- Diversity bonuses: store variety (+10/25/50), deck variety (+15), format variety (+10)

**Store Rating**
- Weighted blend: 50% player strength + 30% attendance + 20% activity
- Based on last 6 months of data
- Normalized to 0-100 scale

**Why calculate ratings in-app vs pre-computed?**
- Data volume is small (~100 results, ~50 players)
- Full Elo calculation takes milliseconds
- Reactive system ensures ratings always fresh
- No need for background jobs or cached tables

### Files Changed
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `R/ratings.R` | New module with three rating calculation functions |
| `app.R` | Source ratings, add reactive calculations, update 4 tables |
| `views/dashboard-ui.R` | Updated tooltip text for new rating explanation |

### Tables Updated
- Overview > Top Players: Rating (Elo) + Achv columns
- Overview > Recent Tournaments: Store Rating column
- Players tab: Rating (Elo) + Achv columns
- Stores tab: Rating column

## 2026-01-31: Mobile UI Polish - Complete

### Summary
Completed mobile UI improvements including responsive value boxes, smart filter layouts, and reduced header/content spacing. Both desktop and mobile designs are now polished and merged to main.

### Key Changes

**Responsive Value Boxes**
- Switched from CSS grid overrides to bslib `breakpoints()` in R code
- `col_widths = breakpoints(sm = c(12,12,12,12), md = c(6,6,6,6), lg = c(3,3,3,3))`
- CSS no longer fights bslib's inline styles
- Full width on mobile, 2x2 on tablet, 4-column on desktop

**Smart Filter Layouts**
- Dashboard uses 2-row layout: Format dropdown (full width), Event type + Reset button
- Other pages (Players, Meta, Tournaments) use 3-row layout: Search, Format, Tab-specific + Reset
- Implemented with CSS `:has()` selector to detect presence of search input
- No JavaScript required, pure CSS solution

**Header/Content Spacing**
- Targeted bslib utility classes that add spacing:
  - `body.bslib-gap-spacing { gap: 0.25rem !important; }`
  - `.bslib-mb-spacing { margin-bottom: 0 !important; }`
  - `.bslib-sidebar-layout { gap: 0 !important; }`
- Reduced header `margin-bottom` from 1rem to 0.25rem
- Mobile gets even tighter spacing (0.125rem)

**Other Mobile Fixes**
- BETA badge hidden on mobile (`display: none` at 576px) to prevent overlap with admin button
- App title shortened to "Digimon TCG Tracker" for better mobile fit

### Technical Decisions

**Why bslib breakpoints() instead of CSS?**
- bslib's `layout_columns()` applies inline styles via JavaScript
- CSS `!important` on grid properties was unreliable
- Using R's `breakpoints()` function works with bslib, not against it
- Cleaner separation: R handles layout, CSS handles aesthetics

**Why CSS :has() for filter layouts?**
- Different pages need different filter row counts
- `:has(.title-strip-search)` detects if search input exists
- No need to add extra classes or modify R code per page
- Modern browsers all support `:has()` selector now

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Title shortened to "Digimon TCG Tracker" |
| `views/dashboard-ui.R` | Added `breakpoints()` to `layout_columns()` for value boxes |
| `www/custom.css` | bslib spacing overrides, filter grid layouts, BETA badge hide |

### Branch Status
Feature branch `feature/ui-design-overhaul` merged to main and deleted. v0.13.0 released.

## 2026-01-31: Title Strip Filter Styling - Desktop Complete

### Summary
Completed comprehensive styling overhaul for title strip filter dropdowns across all pages (Overview, Tournaments, Meta Analysis, Players). Resolved issues with selectize.js rendering inconsistencies by switching to native HTML selects with light backgrounds for maximum readability.

### Key Changes

**Native Selects over Selectize**
- Changed all title strip `selectInput` calls to use `selectize = FALSE`
- Native HTML selects are more consistently stylable across browsers
- Dropdown options now readable with dark text on light backgrounds

**Light Background Input Style**
- Title strip inputs now use light backgrounds (`rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9)`)
- Dark text (`#333333`) for readability in both input display and dropdown menus
- Search inputs updated to match for visual consistency
- Inputs stand out clearly against the dark blue title strip background

**Consistent Choice Structure**
- All min_entries/min_events dropdowns now use `list()` with string values (was `c()` with numeric)
- Labels made more descriptive: "Any Events" → "Any Events", "2+" → "2+ Events"
- Empty string `""` as default/reset value (matches format dropdowns)
- Width increased to 120px for format dropdowns, 120px for filter dropdowns

### Technical Decisions

**Why Native Selects?**
- Selectize.js renders inconsistently across different page contexts
- Native select dropdown styling is handled by the browser
- `selectize = FALSE` gives us full CSS control over the input appearance
- Dropdown options inherit system styling, ensuring readability

**Light Background Approach**
- Original design had transparent dark backgrounds with white text
- Issue: Dropdown menus showed white text on white backgrounds (invisible)
- Solution: Light input backgrounds make dark text visible everywhere
- Trade-off: Inputs are more prominent but highly readable

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `views/dashboard-ui.R` | Changed to `page-title-strip` class, added `selectize = FALSE`, width 120px |
| `views/tournaments-ui.R` | Added `selectize = FALSE`, width adjustments |
| `views/meta-ui.R` | Added `selectize = FALSE`, changed choices to `list()` with strings |
| `views/players-ui.R` | Added `selectize = FALSE`, changed choices to `list()` with strings |
| `app.R` | Updated reset handlers to use `selected = ""` |
| `www/custom.css` | Light background styling for `.title-strip-select .form-select` and `.title-strip-search .form-control` |

### Branch Status
Desktop design is now complete on `feature/ui-design-overhaul` branch. Ready for mobile responsiveness review as next phase.

---

## 2026-01-30: Desktop Design Overhaul Complete

### Summary
Completed comprehensive desktop UI design overhaul implementing a "Digital Digimon" aesthetic across the entire application. The design language draws inspiration from Digimon TCG card designs (grid patterns, circuit/wireframe accents) and digital themes (cyan glow effects, scanner animations).

### Key Design Elements Implemented
1. **Value Boxes** - Grid overlay, circuit corner accents, color-coded borders
2. **Title Strips** - Integrated filter bars with context display
3. **Header/Sidebar** - Grid patterns, circuit lines, glowing nodes
4. **Modals** - Stat boxes with digital aesthetic, section headers with circuit accent
5. **Cards** - Feature cards auto-detect charts and apply grid headers
6. **Loading Screen** - "Opening Digital Gate..." sequence with spinning rings
7. **Empty States** - Scanner aesthetic with corner accents
8. **Map Card** - "Location Scanner" with scan line animation
9. **Online Stores** - Connection node animations

### Technical Decisions
- **CSS Organization**: Grouped by component type with clear section headers
- **Loading Overlay**: Injected via JavaScript to avoid htmlwidgets prependContent warning
- **Placement Colors**: Gold/silver/bronze instead of generic green/blue
- **Icon Animation**: CSS keyframes for subtle pulse/glow effect

### Branch Status
All work on `feature/ui-design-overhaul` branch (16 commits). Not merged to main - pending mobile responsiveness review.

### Next Steps
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness review and fixes
- [ ] Replace placeholder cards icon with actual Digivice SVG
- [ ] Test on various screen sizes and aspect ratios

---

## 2026-01-25: Phase 1 Kickoff - Project Foundation

### Completed
- [x] Created project directory structure (R/, data/, logs/, db/, tests/)
- [x] Added MIT License
- [x] Designed and created database schema for MotherDuck/DuckDB
- [x] Created R database connection module with MotherDuck support
- [x] Set up logging framework (CHANGELOG.md, dev_log.md, archetype_changelog.md)

### Technical Decisions

**Database Choice: MotherDuck (Cloud DuckDB)**
- Rationale: Serverless, fast OLAP queries, excellent R integration via duckdb package
- MotherDuck provides cloud hosting with generous free tier
- Falls back to local DuckDB file for offline development
- Connection uses token-based auth via environment variable

**Schema Design Notes**
- Added `ingestion_log` table for tracking API calls and data imports
- Created views for common dashboard queries (player standings, archetype meta, store activity)
- Junction table `archetype_cards` enables "find decks using card X" feature
- All tables include `created_at` and `updated_at` timestamps

**Environment Configuration**
- MotherDuck token stored in `.env` file (gitignored)
- Database name configurable via `MOTHERDUCK_DATABASE` env var
- Default database name: `digimon_tcg_dfw`

### Next Steps
- [ ] Populate initial DFW store data
- [ ] Build DigimonCard.io API integration
- [ ] Create initial deck archetype reference data
- [ ] Build Shiny data entry forms

---

## 2026-01-25: Database Connection Strategy

### Issue Encountered
MotherDuck extension not available for Windows mingw DuckDB R package (HTTP 404 when installing extension).

### Solution: Dual-Mode Connection
Implemented auto-detecting `connect_db()` function:
- **Windows (local dev)**: Uses `data/local.duckdb` file
- **Linux (Posit Connect)**: Uses MotherDuck cloud

### Rationale
- Posit Connect Cloud runs on Linux where MotherDuck works
- Local development works identically (same DuckDB SQL)
- Python sync script (`scripts/sync_to_motherduck.py`) provided for deployment

### Workflow
```
Local Dev (Windows)     →    Deploy (Posit Connect)
─────────────────────        ────────────────────────
R + local.duckdb             R + MotherDuck
                    ↘      ↗
               Python sync script
               (one-time before deploy)
```

---

## 2026-01-25: Data Entry Architecture Decision

### Decision: Option A - Production Entry
All real data entry happens in production (MotherDuck via Posit Connect app).

**Data Flow:**
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  DEVELOPMENT                    │  PRODUCTION                   │
├─────────────────────────────────┼───────────────────────────────┤
│  local.duckdb                   │  MotherDuck                   │
│  - Test/sample data             │  - Real tournament data       │
│  - Schema development           │  - Entered via Shiny forms    │
│  - Seed scripts for testing     │  - Source of truth            │
└─────────────────────────────────┴───────────────────────────────┘
```

**Reference Data** (stores, archetypes):
- Managed via seed scripts (version controlled)
- Run in production when stores/archetypes need updates

**Transactional Data** (tournaments, results, players):
- Entered via Shiny app forms
- Written directly to MotherDuck

### Future Consideration: Screenshot Parsing
**Idea:** Allow users to upload screenshots of tournament standings (from Bandai TCG+ app) and parse them automatically using OCR/AI.

**Status:** Noted for potential future enhancement. May be too complex for initial scope.

**If implemented, would involve:**
- Image upload in Shiny
- OCR service (Google Vision, AWS Textract, or local tesseract)
- Parsing logic to extract player names, placements, records
- Review/confirmation UI before saving

**Complexity concerns:**
- Variable screenshot formats
- OCR accuracy on phone photos
- Cost of cloud OCR services
- Edge cases (ties, drops, etc.)

Parking this for now - revisit after core app is functional.

## 2026-01-25: Windows DuckDB Extension Limitations

### Issue
Windows mingw DuckDB R package cannot auto-install extensions (JSON, MotherDuck).
Error: `Extension "json" not found` when creating tables with JSON columns.

### Solution
Replaced all `JSON` column types with `TEXT` in schema.
- `stores.schedule_info` → TEXT
- `deck_archetypes.playstyle_tags` → TEXT
- `results.decklist_json` → TEXT
- `ingestion_log.metadata` → TEXT

Use `jsonlite::toJSON()` / `jsonlite::fromJSON()` in R for serialization.

### Result
Schema initialization now succeeds on Windows. All 6 tables + 3 views created.

### Technical Decisions

**UI Framework: bslib + atomtemplates**
- Migrated from shinydashboard to bslib's `page_navbar()`
- Using `atom_dashboard_theme()` for consistent Atom design system
- Enables dark mode support via `input_dark_mode()`
- Better Bootstrap 5 integration and modern responsive design

**Views Folder Structure**
Following Atom Shiny best practices:
```
views/
├── dashboard-ui.R      # Dashboard with value boxes
├── stores-ui.R         # Store directory
├── players-ui.R        # Player standings
├── meta-ui.R           # Meta analysis
├── tournaments-ui.R    # Tournament history
├── admin-results-ui.R  # Tournament entry form
├── admin-decks-ui.R    # Deck archetype management
└── admin-stores-ui.R   # Store management
```

**Styling Architecture**
- `_brand.yml`: Atom color palettes, typography (Poppins, Inter, Fira Code), Bootstrap defaults
- `www/custom.css`: Responsive value boxes, card styling, admin panels, dark mode overrides
- Uses `clamp()` for fluid typography scaling
- Mobile-friendly breakpoints

**Table Rendering: reactable**

- [ ] Date range filtering

---

## 2026-01-26: MapGL Theme and Marker Refinements

### Completed
- [x] Switched to "minimal" basemap theme for consistent appearance in both light/dark app modes
- [x] Fixed popup theme to always use "light" for readability
- [x] Reverted from symbol markers to circle markers for better cross-theme visibility
- [x] Fixed all `set_paint_property` calls to use `circle-color`/`circle-opacity` instead of `icon-*`
- [x] Styled draw control buttons (white with blue border, orange active state)

### Technical Decisions

**Basemap Theme: "minimal" for All Modes**
- Previously tried switching between "light" and "dark" themes based on app dark mode
- Symbol markers with `icon_emissive_strength` only visible in dark mode
- Circle markers lack `emissive_strength` support in mapgl
- Solution: Use "minimal" theme which provides neutral appearance in both modes
- Popups always use "light" theme for consistent readability

**Circle vs Symbol Markers**
- Attempted symbol markers (`add_symbol_layer`) for emissive strength support
- Symbols only rendered in dark mode, invisible in light mode
- Reverted to `add_circle_layer` with orange circles (#F7941D) and white stroke
- Circles visible in both modes, acceptable tradeoff vs 3D lighting effects

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Updated all `atom_mapgl()` to use `theme = "minimal"`, popups use `theme = "light"`, reverted to circle layer, fixed paint property names |
| `www/custom.css` | Draw control button styling (white bg, blue border, orange active) |

### Next Steps
- [x] Enhanced dashboard visualizations (charts for meta share, trends)
- [ ] Player profile views
- [ ] Deck profile views
- [ ] Date range filtering

- [x] Updated dashboard UI with new chart row (3 columns)
- [x] All charts respect store region filter from map
- [x] All charts support light/dark mode via `hc_theme_atom_switch()`

### Technical Decisions

**Highcharter with atomtemplates Integration**
- Using `hc_theme_atom_switch(mode)` to apply Atom-styled themes
- Charts respond to `input$dark_mode` for theme switching

- [x] Replaced Meta Breakdown table with Meta Share Over Time stacked area chart

### Technical Decisions

**Most Popular Deck Value Box**
- Uses `showcase_left_center()` layout with card thumbnail
- Image from DigimonCard.io API
- Respects all dashboard filters (format, event type, date range, store region)
- Falls back to icon if no card image available

**Filter Defaults: Future-Proofed**
- Format defaults to `FORMAT_CHOICES[1]` (always first/most recent format)
- Event type defaults to "locals" (most common event type)
- Reset button restores these defaults, not empty values

**Top Decks: Win Rate %**
- Now sorted by win rate descending (minimum 2 entries)
- Bar width based on win rate relative to max
- Shows both entry count and win rate in stats line

**Top 3 Conversion Rate**
- Changed from top 4 to top 3 finishes
- Shows top 5 decks (was 3) for better visibility
- Minimum 2 entries required

## 2026-01-26: Dashboard Polish - Filters, Charts, and UX Refinements

### Completed
- [x] Added "All Formats" and "All Events" as selectable dropdown options (grouped optgroups)
- [x] Fixed Top Decks math: win rate = 1st place finishes / total tournaments in filter
- [x] Moved tournament count from Top Decks stats to dynamic card header
- [x] Renamed chart titles for clarity (Top 3 Conversion Rate, Color Distribution of Decks Played, Tournament Player Counts Over Time)
- [x] Removed Format column from Recent Tournaments table
- [x] Moved Top Players rating tooltip to (i) icon in card header
- [x] Removed date range filter entirely (simplified UX)
- [x] Made mock data reproducible with `set.seed(42)`

### Meta Share Chart Improvements
- [x] Changed from stacked area to areaspline (curved lines with fill)
- [x] Added custom JS tooltip formatter that filters 0% values
- [x] Tooltip now sorts entries by value descending
- [x] Moved legend to right side with vertical layout and scroll navigation
- [x] Initially added Top 5 / All toggle, then removed for simplicity
- [x] Always shows all decks - legend scroll + tooltip filtering handles complexity

### Technical Decisions

**Grouped Filter Dropdowns**
- Changed from simple named vectors to list structure for optgroups:
  ```r
  choices = list(
    "All Formats" = "",
    "Recent Formats" = FORMAT_CHOICES
  )
  ```
- Empty string value triggers "no filter" in `build_dashboard_filters()`

**Top Decks Win Rate Calculation**
- Win rate = (1st place finishes for deck) / (total tournaments in current filter) × 100
- More meaningful than match win rate for measuring deck success
- Bar width now shows actual percentage (not relative to max)

**Meta Share Chart Design**
- Uses `hc_chart(type = "areaspline")` with `stacking = "normal"`
- Custom JS tooltip formatter:
  - Filters points where `p.y > 0`
  - Sorts remaining points by `b.y - a.y` (descending)
  - Shows deck name with color dot and percentage
- Right-side legend with `maxHeight: 280` and scroll navigation
- Handles many decks gracefully without cluttering the chart

**Info Icon Tooltip Pattern**
- Rating explanation moved from column tooltip to (i) icon in card header
- Uses native `title` attribute for hover tooltip
- CSS styled with `.rating-info-icon` class
- More discoverable and consistent across the app

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Grouped filter choices, Top Decks math fix, meta share areaspline with JS formatter, removed date filter |
| `views/dashboard-ui.R` | Dynamic Top Decks header, (i) icon for rating, simplified meta share card |
| `www/custom.css` | Rating info icon styles, responsive filter grid, removed unused toggle CSS |
| `R/seed_mock_data.R` | Added `set.seed(42)` for reproducibility |

### Next Steps
- [x] Priority 2: Stores improvements (bubble sizing, quality metrics)
- [ ] Priority 3: Players/Meta profiles (individual player/deck pages)
- [ ] Priority 4: Tournaments (full results view, filters)
- [ ] Priority 5: Admin improvements (bulk entry, card search)

## 2026-01-26: Priority 2 - Stores Improvements

### Completed
- [x] Dynamic bubble sizing on map based on tournament activity
- [x] Store metrics in list table (Events, Avg Players, Last Event)
- [x] Store detail modal with click-to-view
- [x] Map legend explaining bubble sizes

### Technical Decisions

**Dynamic Bubble Sizing**
- Query joins stores with tournaments to get activity metrics
- Bubble radius scales from 8px (no events) to 20px (most active)
- Formula: `8 + (tournament_count / max_tournaments) * 12`
- Visual indicator helps users identify active stores at a glance

**Store Activity Metrics**
- Added to `stores_data` reactive: `tournament_count`, `avg_players`, `last_event`
- Uses LEFT JOIN to include stores with zero tournaments
- `last_event` displayed as relative time ("2 days ago", "3 weeks ago")

**Store Detail Modal**
- Click any row in store list table to open modal
- Uses reactable's `selection = "single"` and `onClick = "select"`
- Modal shows:
  - Store info (city, address, website)
  - Activity stats (Events, Avg Players, Last Event)
  - Recent tournaments table (last 5)
  - Top players at store (by wins)
- Uses `showModal()` / `modalDialog()` from Shiny

**Enhanced Popups**
- Map popups now show activity metrics (Events, Avg Players)
- Shows "Last event: X days ago" for active stores
- Subtitle changes to "Active Game Store" for stores with events

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Updated `stores_data` query with metrics, dynamic bubble sizing, store detail modal with recent tournaments and top players |
| `views/stores-ui.R` | Added modal output, click hint, map legend note |

### Next Steps

**Consistent Profile Pattern**
- Both player and deck profiles follow same UX pattern as store detail modal
- Row selection via reactable's `selection = "single"` and `onClick = "select"`
- Cursor pointer styling for clickable rows
- "Click a row for profile" hint in card headers

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Added `ordinal()` helper, player profile modal, deck profile modal, filters for both pages, reactive values for selection |
| `views/players-ui.R` | Added filters (format, min events), click hint, modal output |
| `views/meta-ui.R` | Added filters (format, min entries), click hint, modal output |

### Next Steps
- [x] Priority 4: Tournaments (full results view, filters)
- [ ] Priority 5: Admin improvements (bulk entry, card search)

---

## 2026-01-27: Priority 3 Refinements - Search & Layout

### Completed
- [x] Added search filter to Players page (search by player name)
- [x] Added search filter to Meta page (search by deck name)
- [x] Consistent two-row filter layout on both pages
- [x] Stats layout in profile modals now evenly distributed (justify-content-evenly)
- [x] Store detail modal includes winning deck name and decklist link
- [x] All three profile modals (store, player, deck) have consistent stats styling

### Technical Decisions

**Two-Row Filter Layout**
- Row 1: Search input (max-width 300px)
- Row 2: Dropdowns + Reset button using flexbox with gap-3
- Avoids overlap issues with layout_columns
- Cleaner visual hierarchy

**Search Filter Implementation**
- Case-insensitive partial match using `LOWER(column) LIKE LOWER('%search%')`
- Applied to both main query and row selection query for consistency
- Reset button clears search along with other filters

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Search filters for players and meta, evenly distributed stats in all modals, deck name in store modal |
| `views/players-ui.R` | Two-row filter layout with search |
| `views/meta-ui.R` | Two-row filter layout with search |

### Next Steps

- [x] Enhanced data validation and error handling across admin forms

### Technical Decisions

**Bulk Results Entry**
- Added toggle between "Single Entry" and "Bulk Paste" modes

- Searches deck_archetypes by display_card_id
- Click-to-select deck from search results
- Shows card thumbnails for matching decks

**Data Validation Enhancements**

Tournament Creation:
- Required field validation (store, date, player count, rounds)
- Duplicate tournament warning (same store, date, event type)

Result Entry:
- Required player name and deck validation
- Duplicate placement warning
- Duplicate player in same tournament warning
- URL format validation for decklist URLs
- Case-insensitive player matching (finds existing player first)

Archetype Creation:

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Bulk entry parsing/submission, deck card search, validation for all admin forms |
| `views/admin-results-ui.R` | Entry mode toggle, bulk paste textarea, preview table, card search expander |

### Next Steps
- [ ] Data import/export functionality

## 2026-01-27: Admin UI Polish & Edit Functionality

### Completed
- [x] All admin inputs now single-row layout (no side-by-side fields)
- [x] Fixed card search in Manage Decks (working images, clickable buttons)
- [x] Added quick-add deck feature in results entry
- [x] Added edit functionality for stores and decks (click row to edit)
- [x] Added shinyjs library for show/hide button functionality

### Technical Decisions

**Single-Row Admin Layouts**
- Removed all `layout_columns()` wrappers in admin forms
- Each input field now has its own row for clearer UI
- Better mobile responsiveness

**Card Search Fix (Manage Decks)**
- Changed from inline `onclick` handlers to proper `actionButton` per card
- Switched to .jpg image format instead of .webp for better browser support
- Store card search results in `rv$card_search_results` reactive
- Used `lapply(1:8, ...)` pattern for observeEvent handlers

**Quick-Add Deck in Results Entry**
- Removed confusing "Find deck by card" section
- Added expandable "Quick add new deck" section
- Creates deck with minimal info (name + primary color only)
- Notification reminds user to complete details in Manage Decks later
- Auto-selects newly created deck in dropdown

**Edit Functionality Pattern**
- Click any row in admin tables to populate form for editing
- Hidden `editing_*_id` input tracks edit mode
- Add button hidden, Update button shown during edit
- Cancel Edit button clears form and returns to add mode
- Uses `shinyjs::show()` / `shinyjs::hide()` for button visibility
- Archetype updates refresh both list and results dropdown

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Added shinyjs, quick-add deck, edit observers for stores/decks, fixed card search |
| `views/admin-stores-ui.R` | Single-row layout, edit mode UI, cancel button |
| `views/admin-decks-ui.R` | Single-row layout, edit mode UI, cancel button |

---

## 2026-01-27: Admin UI Fixes - Card Search, Pagination, Alignment

### Completed
- [x] Fixed card search images in Manage Decks (now displaying correctly)
- [x] Added pagination to admin tables (default 20 rows, options: 10/20/50/100)
- [x] Fixed search box and button alignment in Manage Decks
- [x] Added helper text for Selected Card ID field

### Technical Decisions

**Card Search Image Fix**
- DigimonCard.io API returns card number in `id` field, not `cardnumber`
- Previous code was using `card_data$cardnumber` which was undefined
- Fixed to use `card_data$id` for card number
- Image URLs use `.webp` format: `https://images.digimoncard.io/images/cards/{id}.webp`
- Server returns WebP format regardless of file extension in URL

**Debug Logging Added (Temporary)**
- Console logging shows API response structure
- UI debug panel shows column names and image URLs
- Helped identify the `id` vs `cardnumber` field issue
- Can be removed once card search is confirmed stable

**Admin Table Pagination**
- Both Manage Stores and Manage Decks tables now have pagination
- `defaultPageSize = 20` for reasonable default
- `showPageSizeOptions = TRUE` with options `c(10, 20, 50, 100)`
- Improves usability when many entries exist

**Search Box Alignment**
- Changed from flexbox to Bootstrap row/col layout
- Uses `align-items-end` to align button with input field
- Added spacer label (`&nbsp;`) above button for proper vertical alignment

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Fixed card search to use `id` field, `.webp` image format, added pagination to admin tables, debug logging |
| `views/admin-decks-ui.R` | Fixed search box/button alignment with Bootstrap grid |

### API Response Structure (DigimonCard.io)
Key fields returned by `/api-public/search`:
- `id` - Card number (e.g., "BT10-082")
- `name` - Card name
- `color` - Primary color
- `color2` - Secondary color (if any)
- `type` - Card type (Digimon, Tamer, Option)
- `level`, `dp`, `play_cost`, `evolution_cost`
- `digi_type`, `digi_type2`, etc.
- `pretty_url` - URL-friendly name
- NO `image_url` field - must construct URL manually

---

## 2026-01-27: v0.5.0 - Admin Pages Enhancement

### Completed
- [x] Bug fixes: bind parameter error (NULL → NA_character_), search button alignment
- [x] Schema updates: is_online for stores, is_multi_color for deck_archetypes
- [x] Online store support with conditional UI and separate display section
- [x] Deck management: reorganized form, multi-color support, delete functionality
- [x] Store management: online store handling, delete functionality
- [x] Results wizard: 2-step flow replacing bulk paste mode
- [x] Duplicate tournament detection with modal options
- [x] Quick add forms for players and decks during result entry
- [x] Migration script for existing databases

### Technical Decisions

**Online Store Support: Flag-based Approach**
- Added `is_online` boolean column instead of separate table
- Conditional UI using `conditionalPanel()` based on checkbox state
- Physical stores: address, city, state, zip (geocoded)
- Online stores: name, region (no geocoding)
- Display: separate "Online Tournament Organizers" card on Stores page

**Results Entry: Wizard over Bulk Paste**
- Removed bulk paste mode entirely (confusing UX, error-prone parsing)
- 2-step wizard: Tournament Details → Add Results
- Step navigation via `rv$wizard_step` reactive value
- Tournament summary bar persists context in step 2
- Quick-add forms reduce friction for new players/decks

**Delete Functionality: Hard Delete with Referential Integrity**
- Hard DELETE instead of soft delete (is_active = FALSE)
- Pre-delete check counts related records
- Block delete if records exist, show count in error message
- Modal confirmation with specific warning message

**NULL/NA Handling for DuckDB**
- DuckDB bind parameters require NA values, not NULL
- Pattern: `if (nchar(x) > 0) x else NA_character_`
- Fixed throughout: decklist_url, address, zip, state, schedule, website

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Wizard logic, online store handling, delete handlers, quick add forms, NULL fixes |
| `views/admin-stores-ui.R` | Online checkbox, conditional panels, delete button/modal |
| `views/admin-decks-ui.R` | Reorganized layout, multi-color checkbox, delete button/modal |

library(DBI)
library(duckdb)
source("R/migrate_v0.5.0.R")
con <- dbConnect(duckdb::duckdb(), dbdir = "data/local.duckdb")
migrate_v0.5.0(con)
dbDisconnect(con)
```

## 2026-01-27: v0.6.0 - Format Management

### Completed
- [x] Added formats table to database schema for managing game sets
- [x] Created migration script (R/migrate_v0.6.0.R) with seed data
- [x] Built admin UI for format CRUD operations
- [x] Dynamic format dropdown loading from database
- [x] Referential integrity checks for format deletion
- [x] Fixed reactable selection event for row editing

### Technical Decisions

**Formats Table Design**
- `format_id` (VARCHAR PRIMARY KEY): Set code like 'BT19', 'EX08'
- `set_name`: Full name like 'Xros Encounter'
- `display_name`: Combined display like 'BT19 (Xros Encounter)'
- `release_date`: For sorting by newest
- `sort_order`: Manual sort override (lower = appears first)
- `is_active`: Toggle visibility in dropdowns

**Dynamic Format Loading**
- Added `get_format_choices(con)` helper function
- Falls back to hardcoded FORMAT_CHOICES if DB unavailable
- Observer updates dashboard and tournament dropdowns on format change
- `rv$format_refresh` reactive value triggers dropdown updates

**Admin UI Pattern**
- Follows existing stores/decks admin pattern
- Click row to edit, form populates with current values
- Add/Update/Delete buttons with shinyjs show/hide
- Modal confirmation for delete with referential integrity check
- Blocks delete if tournaments reference the format

**Reactable Selection Event**
- Correct pattern: `{outputId}__reactable__selected`
- Initial bug used `__selected` instead of `__reactable__selected`
- Fixed to match working stores/decks implementations

### Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `views/admin-formats-ui.R` | Admin UI for format management |

## 2026-01-27: Card Cache & UI Improvements

### Completed
- [x] Implemented card cache in MotherDuck to bypass DigimonCard.io API 403 blocks
- [x] Created Python sync script for fetching cards from API
- [x] Added GitHub Actions workflow for monthly card sync
- [x] Fixed DuckDB bind parameter error (NULL → NA_character_) for archetype updates
- [x] Added tournament deletion feature via enhanced "Start Over" modal
- [x] UI improvements: card preview placeholder, smaller search inputs, W/L/T stacked layout
- [x] Simplified Manage Formats (auto-generate display_name, sort by release_date)
- [x] Added "Online Tournament" event type
- [x] Removed hardcoded FORMAT_CHOICES, load dynamically from database
- [x] Standardized reset buttons across all filter tabs

### Technical Decisions

**Card Cache for Local Search**
- DigimonCard.io API returns 403 on Posit Connect Cloud (blocks server IPs)
- Solution: Cache 2,843 cards in MotherDuck `cards` table
- Python script `scripts/sync_cards.py` fetches cards respecting rate limits
- R function `search_cards_local()` queries cached cards instead of API
- Card images still loaded from DigimonCard.io CDN (works fine)
- GitHub Actions workflow runs monthly to sync new cards

**Tournament Deletion Feature**
- Enhanced "Start Over" button to show modal with two options:
  - "Clear Results": Keeps tournament, removes results (stays on Step 2)
  - "Delete Tournament": Cascade deletes tournament and all results (returns to Step 1)
- Confirmation shows result count to prevent accidental deletion
- Designed for "accidentally created tournament" use case

**W/L/T Input Layout**
- Attempted various approaches: CSS Grid, flexbox, splitLayout, fixed widths
- Bootstrap 5's form-control has aggressive min-width that resists shrinking
- Final solution: Simple stacked layout with full labels (Wins, Losses, Ties)
- Clean, works reliably, better mobile experience

**Manage Formats Simplification**
- Removed display_name and sort_order fields from UI
- Auto-generate display_name as "{format_id} ({set_name})"
- Sort by release_date DESC (most recent first)
- Reduces admin friction when adding new formats

### Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/sync_cards.py` | Python script to fetch cards from DigimonCard.io API |
| `scripts/migrate_v0.5.0.py` | Python migration for MotherDuck (adds missing columns) |
| `.github/workflows/sync-cards.yml` | Monthly GitHub Actions workflow for card sync |
| `docs/plans/2026-01-27-tournament-deletion-design.md` | Design doc for deletion feature |

### Files Modified
| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `app.R` | Card cache search, tournament deletion handlers, format simplification, NA_character_ fix |
| `db/schema.sql` | Added cards table for cache |
| `R/digimoncard_api.R` | Added search_cards_local() function |
| `views/admin-results-ui.R` | Start over modal, W/L/T stacked layout |
| `views/admin-decks-ui.R` | Card preview placeholder, smaller search inputs |
| `views/admin-formats-ui.R` | Simplified form (removed display_name, sort_order) |
| `views/*.R` | Standardized reset buttons across all filter tabs |

### API 403 Issue Details
- Card search worked locally but returned 403 on Posit Connect
- DigimonCard.io blocks cloud server IP ranges
- Card images (CDN) work fine - only API endpoints blocked
- Cache solution allows full functionality without API dependency

## 2026-01-28: DuckDB Foreign Key Constraint Fix

### Issue
Updating deck archetypes failed with FK constraint error:
```
Constraint Error: Violates foreign key constraint because key "archetype_id: 30"
is still referenced by a foreign key in a different table.
```

This occurred when clicking "Update Archetype" even though UPDATE shouldn't trigger FK violations.

### Root Cause
DuckDB internally rewrites UPDATE statements as DELETE + INSERT. When there are FK references to the row being updated, the DELETE phase fails because the key is "still referenced."

This is a known DuckDB limitation documented in:
- https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/issues/16409
- https://github.com/duckdb/duckdb/discussions/12917

### Solution
Removed FK constraints from the `results` table via migration script (`scripts/migrate_drop_fk.py`).

Since we already handle referential integrity at the application level (checking for references before allowing delete), the FK constraints were redundant and causing problems.

### Migration Details
- Created new results table without REFERENCES clauses
- Copied all existing data (8 results)
- Dropped old table and renamed new table
- Recreated indexes

### Files Created
| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `scripts/migrate_drop_fk.py` | Migration to remove FK constraints from results table |

### Lessons Learned
- DuckDB UPDATE = DELETE + INSERT internally
- Avoid FK constraints on tables that need frequent updates to referenced rows
- Handle referential integrity at application level instead

## 2026-02-06: v0.20.0 Public Submissions & OCR Release

### Overview
Released the public submissions feature allowing anyone to upload tournament results via screenshots. The Google Cloud Vision OCR extracts player data automatically, with pre-matching against the database.

### Completed
- [x] Public "Upload Results" tab with two-step wizard flow
- [x] Google Cloud Vision OCR integration via httr2 direct API calls
- [x] Player pre-matching (by member number first, then username fuzzy match)
- [x] Match status badges (Matched/Possible/New) with color coding
- [x] Match history submission with tournament selector
- [x] Image thumbnail previews (base64 encoded inline)
- [x] Pre-declared player count to prevent data fabrication
- [x] GUEST##### ID handling (ignored, not stored)
- [x] UI redesign: combined cards, compact dropzone, inline tips
- [x] Input width fix for tournament details form
- [x] Apostrophe support in OCR username parsing

### Technical Decisions

**OCR Integration Approach**
- Direct httr2 calls to Google Cloud Vision API (no R packages)
- Stores API key in environment variable (GCP_VISION_API_KEY)
- OCR text parsed line-by-line with regex patterns for usernames, member numbers, and points

**Player Pre-Matching Strategy**
- First priority: exact member number match
- Second priority: fuzzy username match (>80% similarity using stringdist)
- Results tagged as "matched", "possible", or "new" for user review

**GUEST ID Handling**
- Bandai TCG+ uses GUEST##### format for manually-added players
- Decision: ignore these entirely (not real player IDs)
- Not stored in database, not used for matching

**Pre-Declared Player Count**
- User declares total player count before OCR
- System creates exactly N rows (blank rows for OCR misses)
- Prevents fabrication of extra players

### Files Modified
- `R/ocr.R` - OCR parsing logic
- `server/public-submit-server.R` - Submission server logic
- `views/submit-ui.R` - Upload UI
- `www/custom.css` - Upload styling

### Branch
`feature/public-submissions` - ready for merge to main

## 2026-01-30: Value Box Redesign - Digital Digimon Aesthetic

### Overview
Brainstormed and designed a complete redesign of the Overview page value boxes to capture an authentic Digimon TCG aesthetic. The design draws inspiration from actual card designs (EX1 retro grid patterns, card back circuit/wireframe effects).

### Design Decisions

**Visual Direction: Grid + Circuit Aesthetic**
- Grid pattern overlay inspired by EX1 Gabumon card (retro digital feel)
- Circuit/wireframe accents inspired by card backs (glowing nodes, digital lines)
- Color-coded left borders as secondary accent (Orange, Blue, Red, Green)
- Deep blue gradient backgrounds maintained for cohesion

**Stats Redesigned**
- Tournaments: Count for selected format (was all-time)
- Players: Unique players for selected format (was all-time)
- Hot Deck: Biggest meta share increase (NEW - with fallback for insufficient data)
- Top Deck: Most popular deck with card image (kept)

**Filter UI Restructured**
- Replaced separate filter bar with integrated title strip
- Format and Event Type dropdowns moved to compact controls on right
- Left side shows dynamic context: "BT-19 Format · Locals"
- Reset button now just an icon (↺)

### Design Document
Full design specification: `docs/plans/2026-01-30-value-box-redesign-design.md`

### Branch
`feature/value-box-redesign`

### Next Steps
- [ ] Implement title strip UI
- [ ] Refactor value boxes to new layout
- [ ] Add grid/circuit CSS effects
- [ ] Update stats to be format-filtered
- [ ] Add Hot Deck calculation with fallback
- [ ] Test dark mode + responsive
