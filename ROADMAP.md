---

## Removed / Won't Do

| Description | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| Global search bar in header | Not needed — tabs and modals provide sufficient navigation |
| Guided tour (standalone) | Replaced by revamped onboarding modal carousel (OH1) |
| Deck modal: pilots leaderboard | Already covered by Deck Meta tab "top pilots" section |
| Expand to other Texas regions | Already supported by scenes hierarchy (multi-region implemented v0.23) |
| Limitless TCG API deep integration | Completed in v0.24 |
| Date range filtering on dashboard | Not needed — format filter is sufficient |
| Detailed player profile views | Modals already cover this |
| Detailed deck profile views | Modals already cover this |
| Event calendar page | Bandai TCG Plus already covers this |
| Store directory page | Bandai TCG Plus already covers this |
| Data export for users | Handle manually on request |
| Season/format archive view | Format filter already covers this |
| GitHub Action keepalive ping | Burns Posit Connect hours 24/7 for minimal benefit |
| Aggressive idle timeout increases | Wastes Posit Connect hours on zombie sessions |

---

## Post-v1.0 Decision Point: Platform Evaluation

After v1.0 launch data, evaluate whether to begin a Next.js migration based on:

| Question | If Yes → Next.js | If No → Stay Shiny |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Is organic search traffic a growth priority? | SSR pages are crawlable | Word-of-mouth via Discord is enough |
| Hitting Posit Connect scaling limits? | Stateless architecture scales better | Caching solved the problem |
| Want standalone API for bots/tools? | API routes are native | Manual data sharing is fine |
| Want mobile app / PWA features? | Native strengths | Basic PWA on Shiny is sufficient |
| Multiple regions need fast edge loading? | CDN + edge rendering | Single-region performance is adequate |

The React PoC on `explore/react-rewrite` branch serves as a reference for future migration decisions.
