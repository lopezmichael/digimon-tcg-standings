---

## Removed / Won't Do

| Description | Reason |
|-------------|--------|
| Static website at digilab.cards (WS1/WS2/SEO1) | Deferred — community grows via Discord, not Google search. Revisit if organic traffic becomes a priority |
| Structured data JSON-LD (SEO2) | Only useful with static site — deferred with it |
| Search Console integration (SEO3) | Low value without SEO strategy — revisit with static site |
| Embed widgets for stores (F8) | Share links in store/organizer modals already cover this |
| Discord bot for result reporting (P2) | Over-engineered — screenshot OCR + manual entry is sufficient |
| Store "Next Event" / upcoming section (UX7, UX14) | Bandai TCG Plus already covers event discovery |
| Community pulse dashboard (UX8) | Nice-to-have, not essential |
| Format callout banner (UX9) | Nice-to-have, not essential |
| Distance-based store sorting (UX13) | Scene filtering is sufficient |
| Pre-computed dashboard stats cache (MR16) | Partially done in v0.21.1 (ratings cache + bindCache). Revisit if performance degrades |
| Global search bar in header | Not needed — tabs and modals provide sufficient navigation |
| Guided tour (standalone) | Replaced by revamped onboarding modal carousel (OH1) |
| Deck modal: pilots leaderboard | Already covered by Deck Meta tab "top pilots" section |
| Expand to other Texas regions | Already supported by scenes hierarchy (multi-region implemented v0.23) |
| Limitless TCG API deep integration | Completed in v0.24 |
| Date range filtering on dashboard | Not needed — format filter is sufficient |
| Detailed player profile views | Modals already cover this |
| Detailed deck profile views | Modals already cover this |
| Event calendar page | Bandai TCG Plus already covers this |
| Store directory page | Bandai TCG Plus already covers this |
| Data export for users | Handle manually on request |
| Season/format archive view | Format filter already covers this |
| GitHub Action keepalive ping | Burns Posit Connect hours 24/7 for minimal benefit |
| Aggressive idle timeout increases | Wastes Posit Connect hours on zombie sessions |

---

## Post-v1.0 Decision Point: Platform Evaluation

After v1.0 launch data, evaluate whether to begin a Next.js migration based on:

| Question | If Yes → Next.js | If No → Stay Shiny |
|----------|------------------|---------------------|
| Is organic search traffic a growth priority? | SSR pages are crawlable | Word-of-mouth via Discord is enough |
| Hitting Posit Connect scaling limits? | Stateless architecture scales better | Caching solved the problem |
| Want standalone API for bots/tools? | API routes are native | Manual data sharing is fine |
| Want mobile app / PWA features? | Native strengths | Basic PWA on Shiny is sufficient |
| Multiple regions need fast edge loading? | CDN + edge rendering | Single-region performance is adequate |

The React PoC on `explore/react-rewrite` branch serves as a reference for future migration decisions.
